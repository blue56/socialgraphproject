Joey,Monica,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz..."
Ross,Phoebe,"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy..."
Ross,Rachel,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
Phoebe,Monica,"OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
Ross,Rachel,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... "
Chandler,Rachel,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
Joey,Ross,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."

Rachel,Paolo,"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw, animal, sexual..."
Ross,Marcel,"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
Ross,Rachel,"That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."

Chandler,Rachel,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"

Phoebe,Rachel,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
Woman,Monica,Hi. I'm Monica.
Ross,Marcel,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
Joey,Ross,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
Rachel,Don,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. "
Rachel,Mona,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. "
Ross,Marcel,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"

Rachel,Chandler,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
Carol,Ross,"Let it go, Ross."
Ross,Dr. Franzblau,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."

Rachel,Monica,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this"
Rachel,Monica,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
Ross,Rachel,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
Rachel,Ross,"Ross, it's too hard."
Rachel,Ross,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
Man,Rachel,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
Phoebe,Chandler,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like "

Julie,Ross,"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
Rachel,Julie,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick"
Ross,Julie,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I have to say, I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
Ross,Rachel,Rachel! I'll just call her back. 
Monica,Rachel,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
Joey,Phoebe,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
Joey,Chandler,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey Tribbiani says hello. He'll know what it means."
Monica,Phoebe,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
Phoebe,Ross,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
Phoebe,Ross,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in. "
Joey,Ross,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
Rachel,Julie,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
Joey,Ross,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
Joey,Ross,"Look, Rach, Rach! I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
Chandler,Joey,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
Monica,Mary,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
Chandler,Monica,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
Chandler,Joey,Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast
Joey,Chandler,Chandler?
Julie,Rachel,"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
Joey,Monica,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Joey,Rachel,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
Phoebe,Monica,"Monica, she will kill you. She will kill you like a dog in the street."
Ross,Monica,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
Annabelle,Joey,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
Monica,Phoebe,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
Phoebe,Monica,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
Susan,Ross,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. "
Rachel,Phoebe,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
Rachel,Monica,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
Monica,Julie,Julie.
Rachel,Julie,You were with Julie?
Monica,Rachel,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out!"
Rachel,Monica,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to "
Phoebe,Ross,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
Carol,Ross,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it. "
Monica,Rachel,"Rachel, "
Rachel,Monica,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually "
Monica,Julie,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
Julie,Ross,"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
Rachel,Monica,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
Rachel,Ross,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
Rachel,Julie,"All right, Julie."
Phoebe,Monica,Hi Monica!
Janice,Joey,"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
Rachel,Monica,"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
Rachel,Joey,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's"
Joey,Ross,There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
Ross,Chandler,"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
Rachel,Ross,"Ross, you know what..."
Joey,Ross,"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
Rachel,Ross,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
Rachel,Ross,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
Rachel,Joey,Were both of those Joey?
Rachel,Ross,"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And"
Janice,Joey,"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea"

Ross,Chandler,Chandler was totally flirting with the hot delivery girl!
Monica,Chandler,"Chandler, this actually bothers you?"

Joey,Ross,"Ooh, Ross, look! Look! "
Phoebe,Gary,"Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary"
Phoebe,Monica,"Monica, I'm sorry I didn't come by last night. I was out with Gary"

Chandler,Ross,"Yeah! If the car that backfired had run over you! Y'know what, I think I'll go home before Ross starts rambling about his newfound respect for life. "
Joey,Ross,Cut it out Ross! I hate to have to save your life and kick your ass in the same day!
Chandler,Ross,You dove in front of Ross! Ross!
Joey,Ross,"That's what this is about! Oh my God, you hate Ross!"
Chandler,Ross,I do not hate Ross!
Joey,Ross,Of course you do! I saved him! You're mad at me! It all adds up! You want Ross out of the picture.
Chandler,Ross,"Look I'm very glad that you saved Ross from the car backfire, but y'know, it could've been a bullet and you y'know, you didn't try to save me!"
Joey,Ross,"Ohh, you're upset because you think I chose Ross over you! No! I"
Chandler,Ross,"When it comes down to it, you would risk your life for Ross before you would for me. That's the bottom line."
Joey,Ross,"Well, no, not exactly! All right, look, I, I wasn't trying to save Ross. Okay? My sandwich was next to Ross. All right? I was, I was trying to save my sandwich."

Monica,Chandler,"Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, n  Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, n  the funniest guy I have ever met. "
Phoebe,David,I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How n  can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?
Phoebe,Chandler,Really? Chandler?
Monica,Phoebe,Phoebe!
Monica,David,"Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the n  same day that you and Mike exchange keys?"
Phoebe,David,"I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that n  nothing can happen between us. Unless I "
Rachel,Sandy,"Sandy, that's exactly what it is..."
Rachel,Ross,Ross!
Sandy,Delia,Her name is Deliah.
Sandy,Dan,"Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three n  weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this "
Chandler,Monica,Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy n  she's ever met.
Phoebe,David,"Well... but David, just... I just want you to know n  that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things n  I've ever had to do."
Rachel,Sandy,"Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was n  just telling me about how he proposed to his fianc"
Rachel,Ross,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, n  that's all."
Rachel,Sandy,"Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, n  that's all."
Rachel,Sandy,Sandy made Madeleines.

Ross,Rachel,Did Rachel tell you we hired a 
Ross,Rachel,Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.
Joey,Chandler,So what? Being funny is Chandler's

Ross,Rachel,Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. 
Monica,Chandler,"Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! "
Phoebe,David,"No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years n  ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days."

Ross,Rachel,"Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... n  with Emma... uhm... We just feel..."
Monica,Joey,"Joey, I think you should consider something a little n  less risky. I mean, I think in this market, real estate is your best investment.The n  Fed. just lowered the rates and the interest on your mortgage is totally deductible. n  "
Rachel,Ross,"Oh, with the mother, just... just constantly tell n  her how amazing her son is. Take it from me, moms love me. Ross's mom one time n  actually said I'm like the daughter that she never had."
Rachel,Phoebe,"I just finished getting Phoebe all dressed to meet n  Mike's parents. She's so nervous, it's so sweet!"
Joey,Chandler,Hi I'm Joey. This is Chandler.
Chandler,Monica,"We're not gonna have this conversation again... n  Look at this place. Why am I so intimidated by this guy? Pretentious art, this n  huge macho couch. When we know all he does is sit around all day crying about n  losing Monica to a real man! "
Chandler,Monica,There's a tape here with Monica's name on it.
Mike,Phoebe,"Mom, dad, this is Phoebe. Phoebe, these are my parents"
Bitsy,Phoebe,"Phoebe, why don't you come in the living room and meet n  our friends?"
Mike,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'm sure they will, but you don't have to do this... n  I'm wanting them to get to know Phoebe, not "
Theodore,Phoebe,"Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle."
Theodore,Tom,"Phoebe, these are our friends, Tom and Sue Angle."
Bitsy,Phoebe,"Phoebe, come sit. Tell us a little bit about yourself... n  So where are you from?"
Chandler,Don,"Don't judge me, I'm only human!"
Mike,Phoebe,Phoebe writes lots of great songs. Wha... What was that n  one you sang the other night that everybody just loved?
Mike,Phoebe,"Mom, I thought I told you... Phoebe's a vegetarian."
Mike,Phoebe,Phoebe you don't have to eat...
Monica,Chandler,"Chandler, this is not our problem. We've got each n  other. That's all that matters."
Bitsy,Jen,"By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? n  Tom and Sue's daughter Jen."
Bitsy,Tom,"By the way, do you know who's moving back into town? n  Tom and Sue's daughter Jen."
Theodore,Michael,"You remember her Michael, she's lovely and... well n  behaved and... single."
Mike,Phoebe,"All right, stop! You know, all Phoebe has done tonight n  is trying to get you to like her. And maybe that hasn't been clear all the time, n  but she did her best. And yeah... She's a little different than you are..."
Bitsy,Michael,"Michael, a pimp spit in her mouth! "
Ross,Rachel,Rachel please! That is so inappropriate!
Phoebe,Chandler,"Yeah, Chandler why don't you take a walk? This doesn't concern you."
Rachel,Monica,We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.
Rachel,Don,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Rachel,Joey,"Don't worry, we're just gonna search here for an hour, and then we're gonna go over to Joey's and search, OK?"
Chandler,Monica,"No not okay, you can't look for Monica's presents!"
Rachel,Chandler,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Rachel,Monica,"Chandler, aren't you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?"
Rachel,Chandler,"Chandler, that's not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And you've just gotten her one great present? I mean that's just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?"
Joey,Ross,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet"
Ross,Chandler,"I'm sorry Chandler, but this, this is really important to me."
Chandler,Wendy,"Ah, well no, it's just uh, me and Wendy."
Monica,Wendy,Wendy? 
Joey,Wendy,"Ahh, wait, is Wendy the runner"
Chandler,Joey,"Well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old."
Chandler,Monica,Monica.
Phoebe,Chandler,"Chandler, your being here is the best Christmas present I could have ever imagined."
Phoebe,Joey,"Joey, can I have a sip of your coffee and a bite of your muffin?"
Ross,Lauren,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?

Ross,Ralph Lauren,Rachel and I are bringing Emma to Ralph Lauren today to introduce her to everyone. Doesn't she look cute?

Guy,Gavin,"I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job."
Guy,Gavin Mitchell,"I'm Gavin Mitchell, the person who's taken over your job."
Phoebe,Joey,"Joey, look at me! I'm a nurse!"
Joey,Don,"Oh, relax. Don't be. You'll be fine, you'll be fine. They'll probably just make you stand in the back."
Joey,Don,"Hey, you know what? Don't worry, Pheebs! It usually takes me three takes too! "
Interviewer,Monica,Monica warned me you might do that. I actually think we might have something for you at the agency. 
Interviewer,Monica,Come on now. Monica has a good job. And it's not like you have a family to support.
Chandler,Monica,"Actually, we're trying, and I don't think Monica's gonna wanna postpone it. We're supposed to have sex tonight.  Actually, she's probably at home naked right now. I tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. I can just picture her on the bed right now."
Rachel,Don,"Alright! Don't get too comfortable there, because I'm back in two weeks! And I want everything back to the way it was.  I can't say that I care too much for the way you've rearranged my office. "
Gavin,Lauren,"Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together."
Gavin,Ralph Lauren,"Well, there was talk of shutting down Ralph Lauren all together."
Rachel,Mr. Zelner,"Oh, hi Mr. Zelner."
Rachel,Gavin,"That's great. So now, Super Gavin, when I come back where are you planning on flying off to?"
Gavin,Mr. Zelner,"Well, that's up to Mr. Zelner. I'm sure he will make the right decision."
Joey,Nurse,"That's right, you're not. You're a nurse. You're Nurse With Tray. "
Phoebe,Joey,Joey.
Joey,Nurse,"No, no. Nurse With Tray doesn't know Joey, she doesn't have time for friends. She gets in that operating room and she carries that tray to the doctor, because if she doesn't, people die!"
Rachel,Ross,Ross?
Ross,Monica,So you have to tell Monica you don't want to have a baby right now?
Chandler,Ross,"Yeah, Ross is here so..."
Phoebe,Joey,"Joey, listen. I can't do this, it doesn't make any sense. Yesterday I was a nurse, and today I'm a waitress at a cafe?"
Rachel,Ross,"What? I can't do that! I have the baby, and Ross is not gonna pick her up for another hour."
Rachel,Gavin,"Well, there you go. You win, you win. You get to do the presentation, you'll knock 'em dead,  no one will ever remember that I worked here, and then Ralph will buy his helicopter, and Super Gavin will just fly right along side of him!"
Joey,Tom,"Thank you, thank you. How about I do something for you? Tomorrow, I'll bring you a hat, cover up the bald?"
Chandler,Rachel,"Oh, she's at home, putting up decorations for Rachel's birthday party tonight."
Rachel,Gunther,"Shhh don't say that loud, Gunther's gonna want to hug me."
Ross,Molly,"Uh, good news everyone, we finally found a nanny. This is Molly "
Rachel,Molly,"Oh, wow, Molly is just great!"
Rachel,Joey,And Joey?
Rachel,Ross,Am I the only one who doesn't think that she's hot? Ross?
Chandler,Rachel,Now that Rachel's gone?
Phoebe,Bob,"OK, fine, if it means that much to you I'll get rid of Bob."
Rachel,Gavin,"Gavin, I just wanted to say thank you again for watching Emma    yesterday during the presentation. I really owe you an appology."
Chandler,Joey,Looks like Joey is doing allright with her.
Monica,Joey,"Yeah. Hey, that was nice of you guys to back off and let Joey get the girl    for once."
Ross,Joey,"Joey, come on now, for me! Please, just"
Phoebe,Bob,To kill Bob??
Phoebe,Bob,"I'll find Bob, I'll get him. Bob? "
Phoebe,Bob,"I don't know, I kinda like Bob for a girl."
Phoebe,Bob,"Oh my god, we killed Bob!"
Mike,Bob,"Maybe it wasn't Bob, maybe it was a mouse."
Ross,Joey,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
Ross,Molly,"Listen, can you do me a favor? I'm gonna be out today. Can you just keep    an eye on Joey, make sure nothing happens between him and Molly?"
Chandler,Joey,"Allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. Because you know    as well as I do that once Joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,    he's going to have sex with it."
Joey,Ross,"Now YOU'RE telling me I can't see her?? You guys are killing me!    She's forbidden fruit! It's like ... like she's the princess and I'm the stable    boy ... Why are you doing this, huh? Did Ross tell you not to let me go over    there?"
Gavin,Gavin Mitchell,Gavin Mitchelle's office.
Rachel,Gavin,"Um, excuse me Gavin, I have a question I need to ask you."
Rachel,Gavin,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce    you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin    Mitchelle. "
Rachel,Monica,"Yeah I am, I am! Oh, but first of all, Monica, I would like to introduce    you to my very talented colleage and more importantly my wonderful friend Gavin    Mitchelle. "
Monica,Rachel,Pleased to meet you. So you're coming to Rachel's party tonight?
Rachel,Gavin,"Oh no no no no no, Gavin can't, he already has plans, most likely with his    mother. "
Rachel,Monica,"Oh, Monica, you think Skippy liked you? Honey, all those buys had a bet    to see if he can knock you over."
Phoebe,Rachel,"I had to bring them! We killed their mother, they're our responsibility    now. You know, they require constant care. You should know that, Rachel, you're    a mother."
Phoebe,Rachel,"Well I'm sorry Rachel, but I'm not like you, ok? Not everyone    can afford help. "
Ross,Joey,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Ross,Molly,Where the hell are Joey and Molly? I asked you to watch them.
Joey,Molly,"So you see, Molly, what people don't understand is that acting is a discipline.    It takes a lot of hard work."
Joey,Molly,Molly ... people don't study acting ...
Ross,Molly,"Molly, ah, do you mind giving us just a minute?"
Woman,Molly,"Hi, is Molly here?"
Ross,Molly,"Yeah, come on in. Molly?"
Phoebe,Bob,"Yeah, ok. I guess you're right. Allright, so we should just give them away.    But to nice families, with children, and reduced fat wheat thins. They're Bob's    favorites. "
Monica,Gavin,"Well, at least you have one thing to be happy about. That jerk Gavin from    your office didn't show up "
Rachel,Gavin,"See, Gavin, you're capable of being a nice guy. Why did you give me such    a hard time?"
Rachel,Monica,Well Monica seems to think it's because you have feelings for me.
Rachel,Gavin,"See? Why, Gavin, why? Right when I'm about to change my opinion    of you, you go and you ... "
Rachel,Joey,"Oh, Joey, it's so great to be back here. I gotta tell you, you're       making it so easy on me and Emma."
Joey,Rachel,"Yeah. And look, I just want you to know that with Rachel staying       here and everything, all my feelings from before are totally over, okay?       And even if they weren't, when you accidentally walk in on a woman using       a breast pump..."
Ross,Rachel,"Sure, I mean, do I wish me and Rachel living together would have       worked out? Of course. You know, I'm disappointed, but it's not like it's       a divorce."
Ross,Rachel,"No, it's not a divorce, it is not a divorce! Anyway, I think Rachel       and I need to, you know, get on with our lives, maybe, maybe start seeing       other people."
Phoebe,Rachel,"Goodie! Thanks. So, how is it living with Rachel again? I mean, apart       from the great food."
Joey,Ross,"I'm fine, I'm fine, it's just, it's just weird what's happening with       her and Ross. You know, yesterday he asked me to fix him up with somebody."
Phoebe,Rachel,"Oh my god, Rachel asked me if I knew anyone for her too."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Well, Phoebe set me up on a date. "
Monica,Ross,"Just figured, 'cause you and Ross are..."
Phoebe,Joey,"Ooh, Joey. "
Phoebe,Ross,"Well, Ross does. What... You're "
Phoebe,Joey,Joey.
Phoebe,Ross,"What if we don't find him somebody else? We'll just tell her the       date's off, but we don't tell Ross, and he goes to the restaurant and gets       stood up!"
Phoebe,Rachel,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
Phoebe,Ross,"Ooh, so this is great! Rachel's gonna have a terrible date, Ross       gets stood up, and then they'll realise how good they have it together."
Chandler,Don,"No, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! It's okay, it's okay. I didn't go.       Don't cry, it's just a bit! I'm your uncle Chandler"
Monica,Chandler,Chandler!
Rachel,Phoebe,"Phoebe, it's me. I'm going to hunt you down and kill you!"
Monica,Chandler,She's asleep. Chandler?
Chandler,Don,"Don't ask me, I was in there canoodling you!"
Monica,Rachel,"Okay, okay, I'm sure that Rachel came home early and picked up Emma.       You go look across the hall, and I'll call her cell."
Monica,Rachel,"Hey, you better hope that we're pregnant, because one way or another,       we're giving a baby back to Rachel."
Rachel,Don,Don't touch my coat!
Joey,Chandler,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. 
Joey,Don,Don't you lie to me! I could tell by Chandler's hair. 
Chandler,Monica,"All right, all right, we were. We were trying to make a baby. Monica's       ovulating."
Joey,Rachel,Hey! It is unacceptable that you two would have sex with Emma in       the next room. I'm gonna have to tell Rachel about this. 
Monica,Joey,"No, please don't. Please, Joey. She will kill us!"
Ross,Monica,Monica told me you had a blind date.
Phoebe,Joey,"Now, wait a minute. So, they're gonna name their first child Joey?"
Phoebe,Rachel,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
Phoebe,Ross,"Oh my god! Look, it's Ross and Rachel. Oh, the plan is working."
Phoebe,Don,"Don't, don't do the plan"
Joey,Ross,"Hey Ross, check this out! "
Joey,Chandler,"Oh, it was a lot of fun right up until Chandler got a finger in the eye!"
Joey,Chandler,Chandler... hey... 
Rachel,Joey,"Joey... are you sure? I mean, I know how much you love him!"
Joey,Rachel,"Rachel... let's be clear on this, ok? I do not love Hugsy. I like him a normal amount... "
Monica,Phoebe,Hey Phoebe... how you doin'? You feelin' better?
Monica,Ross,"Alright, wait a second, why would Ross tell everyone in your class that you are as...  "
Monica,Phoebe,"Phoebe, that's how it starts. I don't need to eat the cake, I'll just smell the icing... why don't I just eat a little sliver, or, okay, just a slice or two. And next thing you know, you're 210 pounds and you get wedged in going down the tunnel slide. Phoebe, honey, I know this is hard. Look, if you talk to him, you're going to wanna see him. And if you see him, you're going to want to get back together with him. I know that's not what you want. "
Monica,Phoebe,"Phoebe, where's your purse?"
Monica,Phoebe,Phoebe come here
Phoebe,Monica,Damn you Monica Geller hyphen Bing!
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, Emma's right here! You promised not to bring girls home in the middle of the day anymore."
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, come on!"
Monica,Phoebe,"So Phoebe, why are there men's shoes by the door."
Phoebe,Monica,"Monica, I really appreciate you checking in on me, but I'm actually feeling a lot better. Yeah, I just kinda want to be alone right now."
Mike,Phoebe,Phoebe called me.
Monica,Phoebe,Phoebe!
Monica,Phoebe,Damnit Phoebe! How did you even call him?
Mike,Phoebe,"Look, if I wanna see Phoebe and she wants to see... "
Chandler,Ross,"Hey, Ross, I just wanted to apologize... "
Chandler,Ross,"Ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? "
Chandler,Ross,"Ross, don't press send, don't press se... !"
Joey,Monica,"It's Monica, ok?"
Rachel,Monica,That's not Monica!
Rachel,Joey,Yeah! And she's comforted by him because she loves her uncle Joey so much.
Rachel,Joey,"Oooh... you're sweet, I knew uncle Joey would step up. "
Monica,Phoebe,"Hi, that's what I'm doing for Phoebe!"
Tom,Chandler,"Hi, you're Chandler Bing, right? I'm Tom Gordon, I was in your class."
Tom,Ross,"Thanks... uh... I'm so sorry about Ross, it's... "
Chandler,Tom,"Some guy, Tom Gordon."
Monica,Ross,"So, did you know Ross well?"
Tom,Chandler,"Oh, actually I barely knew him. Yeah, I came because I heard Chandler's news. D'you know if he's seeing anyone?"
Chandler,Monica,"You gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and Monica... it's probably the way you stand!"
Kori,Ross,Hi. I'm here for Ross Geller's memorial service.
Chandler,Kori Weston,Kori? Kori Weston?
Chandler,Don,"Don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood! "
Kori,Ross,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
Chandler,Ross,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
Ross,Kori Weston,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
Ross,Phoebe,"Phoebe, what happened?"
Chandler,Monica,"What? No, I'm taking Monica to a romantic inn in Vermont "
Monica,Ross,Why don't you take Ross?
Rachel,Joey,"Hey Joey, is this the bed where Olivia lost her virginity?"
Director,Joey,"Joey, Joey! We're ready for you!"
Monica,Phoebe,Listen Phoebe...
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, I gotta tell ya, I've been thinking "
Joey,Monica,"Oh, all right, I can ask Monica."
Ross,Chandler,"No, Chandler, you have to find the line between stealing and taking what the hotel owes you. For example"
Rachel,Joey,"Ok, well this is like that...in no way. I had a...I had a dream last night that I wanted to kiss Joey."
Monica,Joey,"I don't know. I mean, you saw him do a love scene, so maybe you don't have a thing for Joey, maybe you have a thing for Drake."
Rachel,Joey,Ah! Well it was Joey reading Drake's lines in the dream...
Phoebe,Monica,"Here, Monica, look what I got to wear when I play at the restaurant "
Monica,Phoebe,"Oh...Phoebe? Maybe I wasn't clear before. I really love listening to your music here, but my restaurant is sort of an upscale place."
Monica,Phoebe,"Phoebe, it's not what you wear. It's sort of your songs... I just don't think you should play at the restaurant anymore."
Monica,Phoebe,"Phoebe, it's not about quantity."
Phoebe,Monica,"Well at least all my songs don't taste like garlic. Yeah, there are other ingredients Monica."
Phoebe,Monica,"You'd better get back in that kitchen Monica, the garlic is not gonna overuse itself."
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, do you have peanut butter on the back of your head?"
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, is this that thing that you do when you say you're bad so I'll give you a compliment?"
Monica,Rachel,"No, no, Rachel?"
Monica,Joey,You wanna fool around with Joey?
Rachel,Don,"Ok, off the top of my head... Don and Janet."
Monica,Rachel,"Rachel, things can get incredibly complicated."
Chandler,Ross,"Yes, but, Ross you"
Joey,Roger,I didn't have to tell you that!! I'm stupider than Jane Rogers!!
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, why wouldn't you invite us to your parties?"
Rachel,Joey,"Oh, Joey, come on! Please, please! Let me come, I will behave, I promise! I will behave! Please, please, please..."
Ross,Rachel,"I'm sorry, Rachel, this is Charlie Wealer, she's a collegue."
Monica,Rachel,"Hey, Rachel, Can"
Monica,Joey,You just wanna stay home so you can make a move on Joey!
Monica,Joey,Joey is having a secret Days Of Our Lives party up on the roof!
Phoebe,Joey,Joey's having a party and he wasn't gonna invite us?
Phoebe,Joey,We know about your party Joey.
Monica,Kyle,Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Monica,Kyle Lowder,Oh my God! Kyle Lowder!
Phoebe,Monica,"Monica, you might want to remember that you are married. Where"
Monica,Joey,I guess you have forgotten all about Joey?
Rachel,Chandler,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
Rachel,Joey,"Yeah, well, I guess I have forgotten about Joey and clearly you've forgotten about Chandler!"
Monica,Chandler,Please... Chandler is the love of my life... 
Ross,Albert,"Ooh... so sad... Still, it can't be easy for you to leave Harvard? Especially after working alongside a Nobel Prize winner like Albert Wintermeyer?"
Ross,Albert,You... you dated Albert Wintermeyer?
Phoebe,Ross,Hey Ross!
Joey,Ross,"Hey Ross, this is one of my co"
Joey,Ross,"Hey Ross, listen, Dirk was wondering about the woman that you brought and if you guys were together, or..."
Joey,Monica,Monica!
Monica,Don,"Don't worry Joe, I won't come next year!"
Rachel,Joey,"Joey, you're so sweet."
Rachel,Joey,"Oh, Very funny... Joey."
Phoebe,Ross,"Hey Ross! So listen, about you and the dinosaur girl, are you really just gonna let a couple of Nobel prizes scare you off? What is that, come on, a piece of paper?"
Phoebe,Devon,"Good for you! And hey, I thought your paper on punctuated equilibrium in the Devonian era was top notch!"
Rachel,Chandler,"Please, what about you and Chandler?"
Rachel,Joey,"I could, I could but I don't want to! I want to kiss Joey!"
Phoebe,Chandler,"Hey, thank you so much for these tickets, Chandler."
Monica,Joey,"It's so weird, how did Joey end up kissing Charlie last night?    I thought you'd end up kissing Charlie."
Rachel,Joey,"I don't know why Joey had to kiss her! I mean, of all the girls    at the party, GOD!"
Monica,Rachel,"Yes Rachel, why"
Phoebe,Joey,"Wow, Joey and a professor! Can you imagine if they had kids    and if the kids got her intelligence and Joey's raw sexual magnetism... Oh,    those nerds will get"
Rachel,Ross,"All right, so... Ross, you're ok with all this? I mean..."
Charlie,Joey,"You know, actually I'm a little surprised to myself. I mean,    Joey is so different from the guys I usually date. I mean, they're all professors,    and intellectuals, and"
Monica,Phoebe,"Oh, you can't show Phoebe this! She hates those corporate massage    chains."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Phoebe, come on, I don't wanna waste it! It would be like throwing    away a hundred bucks!"
Phoebe,Rachel,"I feel really strongly about this, Rachel. Please, don't use    this gift certificate. I'm asking you as a friend."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Oh, not as a friend, Phoebe!! Fine, I won't use it!"
Receptionist,Phoebe,"Phoebe, your next client's in the waiting room."
Joey,Ross,Ross!
Janice,Chandler,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
Janice,Monica,"Oh, Chandler, look. You and Monica are meant to have children.    I am sure it's gonna be just fine."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Oh! Phoebe, why did you lie to me about working here?"
Rachel,Phoebe,"Phoebe, honey, if you hate it so much, you should walk out there    right now and quit! Be true to what you believe in! Honey, you have principles    and I"
Ross,Joey,"Yeah? Joey really knows his art, huh?"
Charlie,Joey,"Actually, you know, Joey is your friend, and you don't really    know me that well"
Ross,Joey,"And if you think about it, I mean the reason he memorized all    that stuff is because he thought it was important to you. You    know, that's the kind of guy Joey is."
Monica,Chandler,Chandler?
Receptionist,Phoebe,Good morning Phoebe.
Phoebe,Rachel,Rachel Green? 
Joey,Rachel,"Are you kidding? Rachel loves to shop! And she has great taste! Yeah, she's the one who taught me, you don't wear white after labour day and that you always, always, always have to put on underwear when you're trying on clothes."
Monica,Don,"Don't worry, after a while he'll tune it out."
Rachel,Phoebe,"Hi! Ok, you're ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping?"
Chandler,Monica,"Well... there's surrogacy, but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her."
Joey,Ross,"Come on Ross, be a good guy. Step up and do it!"
Phoebe,Russ,"Ok. Oh good, I'm dating a Russian cab driver. "
Rachel,Melanie,On Melanie Griffith in 
Charlie,Joey,"Yeah! Actually Joey and I are going to the movies tonight, wanna come?"
Rachel,Joey,"I don't know, you know, just the way she waltzed in here all smart, and tall! You know, and just swept Joey off his feet... I mean, nobody else has a chance!"
Rachel,Monica,"Anybody! You, me, you know, Monica's mom..."
Phoebe,Joey,You like Joey?
Rachel,Phoebe,"Shhhhh! Phoebe! All right, look. I have a little thing for him."
Monica,Chandler,"Chandler, this is crazy! What did you even say to him! "
Monica,Chandler,Chandler!
Ross,Joey,"Joey! Hey, I need to talk to Charlie. Is she there?"
Joey,Rachel,No. no... eh... she went shopping with Rachel. Why? What's up?
Joey,Ross,"Fine, I'll rent a car and drive...! Ross, you have to get that job!"
Phoebe,Rachel,"Oh! I'm sorry Rachel, I don't have time for your childish games, ok? I still have to go find something incredible to wear so I can beat Mike at "
Charlie,Joey,No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Charlie,Phoebe,No! There's nothing to explain. I heard you. Phoebe likes Joey.
Charlie,Joey,"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"
Charlie,Phoebe,"It's just that... I don't understand it... I mean, Phoebe likes Joey and then she comes here to buy a dress to impress another guy...?"

Phoebe,Monica,"Really, it doesn't mean anything. I mean, you know, Monica refers to Chandler as Richard"
Phoebe,David,"I'm sooo sorry!! I just... I keep thinking about Mike! I'm crazy about David, and we're having so much fun together. Why"
Chandler,David,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."
Chandler,Joey,"David, let me stop you there 'cause I think I see where this is going. I'm not very good at giving advice. So if you want advice, go to Ross, Monica, or... Joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee."

David,Phoebe,"Sorry, I just... I wish there was something I could do, you know? Well, you know Phoebe..."
David,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, uh... I just wish I could make her forget about Mike already, you know... Why did Phoebe and Mike break up?"
Chandler,David,"David, I'm pretending to"
Charlie,Ross,Oh I can't... I have seminars all day and I promised Ross I would look at his speech.
Monica,David,Wow! That Mike thing was interesting! I don't know what's gonna happen with Phoebe and David.

Monica,Chandler,"Chandler, we have talked about this. You are not supposed to give people advice! Now couldn't you just have made some sort of inappropriate joke?"
Monica,Phoebe,They've only been going out for a few weeks and Phoebe is completely hung up on Mike! She'll say 
Rachel,Monica,"Alright, I don't wanna alarm anybody, but Monica's hair is twice as big as it was when we landed!"

Charlie,Ross,Ross just read me his speech. It's fantastic!
Ross,Chandler,"What... what am I gonna do? My speech is gone, Chandler!"

Monica,David,"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "
Monica,Phoebe,"This is Monica! I'm Phoebe's friend. Listen, Phoebe is back with David and he's going to propose to her, and she is going to say "

Mike,David,"Sorry David, but she really has to know this."
David,Phoebe,"Phoebe, will you marry me?"
Phoebe,David,"David, I'm so sorry, I'm sorry."
Chandler,Ross,Ladies? Ross's speech is in 45 minutes.
Monica,Phoebe,... Phoebe...?
Joey,Ross,"I mean, she should be with someone like... Ross! You know what I mean, he uses all those big words too! Man, smart people are dull!"
Charlie,Ross,"Ross, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Charlie,Joey,"Uh, well... Joey and I broke up."
Charlie,Joey,"Joey is a great guy, but we're just... so different! I mean, during your speech he kept laughing at homo erectus!"
