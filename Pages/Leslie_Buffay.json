Her parents had trouble conceiving naturally (most likely due to Alice's age), so Frank asked his sister, [[Phoebe Buffay]], as their wedding present, to be the surrogate of their child. Leslie was born, along with Frank Jr. Jr. and Chandler, in the episode \"[[The One Hundredth]]\".\n\nThey were seen again aged one in the [[The One With Joey's Porsche|sixth]] season, and aged five in the [[The One Where Ross Is Fine|last season]]. Frank asks Phoebe to adopt one of them (similarly to \"[[The One Hundredth]]\",\u00a0when Phoebe asks Rachel to ask Frank Jr. if she can keep one of the babies), but subsequently realizes he loves them too much to give one away.\n\n[[File:5x03 Phoebe and Triplets.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Phoebe with the triplets, just after their birth.]]\n\n[[Phoebe Abbott]] is not Leslie's grandmother because her father, Frank Jr, and Phoebe Buffay have different mothers (both adoptive and biological). [[Lily Buffay]] is not related to Frank Jr. by blood, and Phoebe Abbott is Phoebe and [[Ursula Buffay|Ursula]]'s biological mother, but not Frank Jr.'s. Frank Jr. is the child of [[Frank Buffay Sr.|Frank Buffay Sr]] and an [[Mrs. Buffay (Frank Sr.'s second wife)|unnamed woman]].\n\n==Trivia==\n* No one seemed to notice that Leslie is the name of Phoebe's [[Leslie|ex-singing partner]].\n* In the episode \"[[The One With Joey's Porsche]]\" it becomes obvious that the triplets are portrayed by quadruplets, where only one is a girl (when Leslie is seen sitting in a green dress, it is clearly visible that the person is\u00a0a boy, but when Phoebe picks her up, it's a girl).\u00a0\n[[Category:Phoebe's Family]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Images of The Triplets]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Multiple Birth Characters]]\n[[Category:Triplets]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters played by different actors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
