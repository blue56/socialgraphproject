He also appeared in [[The One With The Chicken Pox]] where he hired [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] (who started to go by his new character, Joseph) as Chandler's co-worker, even though Chandler was irritated with \"Joseph\" ruining his life and eventually got him to quit by threatening to have an affair with the latter's imaginary wife, Karen.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Chandler's Work]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
