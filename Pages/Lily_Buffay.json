Consequently, Lily was probably bisexual. [[Phoebe Abbott|Phoebe]] gave the twins to Lily and [[Frank Buffay|Frank]] to raise and they later married. [[Frank Buffay|Frank]] abandoned them, divorcing Lily who later remarried to a man who went to prison. The man is her widower.\n\nLily committed suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning when Phoebe and Ursula were around 14. According to Phoebe, she was a drug dealer (''Phoebe: \"My mother was killed by a drug dealer.\" Monica: \"Your mother killed herself.\" Phoebe: \"She was a drug dealer!\"'').\n\nPhoebe tends to use her mother's suicide to get things like a guy's phone or a blueberry muffin. According to a song written by Phoebe, Lily was subsequently cremated.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's Family]]\n[[Category:Mothers]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Divorcees]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:LGBT Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
