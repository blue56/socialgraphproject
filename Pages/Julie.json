She was portrayed by [[Lauren Tom]].\n\nRoss and Julie first met in grad school. Julie was in charge of a dig Ross participated in, and the two started dating. Julie was unwittingly sabotaged by Rachel on multiple occasions, although she admitted to having a feeling that [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] didn't like her [Julie]. For instance, Rachel told Phoebe to give Julie a terrible haircut and attempted to stall Ross and Julie consummating their relationship. Rachel very obviously disliked Julie, often insulting her behind her [Julie's] back. Rachel's dislike toward Julie was fueled further when Julie took Monica shopping, and Rachel felt as if Julie was trying to steal everyone from her.\n\nRoss and Julie break up when Rachel admits her feelings to Ross over his answering machine. It was said that Ross and Julie's break up was rather harsh, that she was very angry, that they both cried and she threw things at him. A few weeks later, however, she managed to recover and eventually met [[Russ]], whom she instantly fell in love with.\n\nIn a 2019 interview,  [[Lauren Tom]] thinks Russ and Julie are still together in 2019 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s2nCm0a9Nc source]).\n\n==Appearance==\nJulie is a slim, beautiful woman with dark hair and brown eyes. Her hair is just below shoulder length in her first appearance on the show, and returns with a short bob after Phoebe offers to cut her hair.\n\nShe wears mostly black and white, with a simple yet feminine style.\n\n==Trivia==\n* It's mentioned that Julie's second grade teacher was named Ms. Thomas, and her first grade teacher Mrs. Cob in \"[[The One With Phoebe's Husband]]\".\n* Julie admitted to being intimidated by Rachel in \"[[The One With The Breast Milk]]\".\n* Ross and Julie almost adopted a cat together in \"[[The One Where Ross Finds Out]]\".\n* In \"[[The One With Russ]]\", Julie appears during the credits scene where she is smitten with Ross' doppelg\u00e4nger, [[Russ]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n* \u201d[[The One Where Rachel Finds Out]]\u201d (First Appearance)\n* \u201d[[The One With Ross' New Girlfriend|The One With Ross\u2019 New Girlfriend]]\u201d\n* \u201d[[The One With The Breast Milk]]\u201d\n* \u201c[[The One With Phoebe's Husband|The One With Phoebe\u2019s Husband]]\u201d\n* \u201d[[The One With Five Steaks And An Eggplant]]\u201d (Mentioned Only)\n* \u201d[[The One Where Ross Finds Out]]\u201d \n* \u201c[[The One With The List]]\u201d\n* \u201c[[The One With Phoebe's Dad|The One With Phoebe\u2019s Dad]]\u201d (Mentioned Only)\n* \u201d[[The One With Russ]]\u201d (Final Appearance)\n* \u201c[[The One With The Invitation]]\u201d (Flashback Only)\n* \u201c[[The One With Joey's Interview|The One With Joey\u2019s Interview]]\u201d (Flashback Only)\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ross' relationships]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
