He is the ex-head chef at [[Allesandro's]], the restaurant which [[Monica Geller|Monica]] works in from [[Season 4]] until [[Season 9]]. He was sacked by [[Allesandro]] and replaced by Monica as head chef of the restaurant. Every employee was upset to lose him because he was literally\u00a0family to several of\u00a0them. They all disliked Monica for replacing him and also partly because of an extremely critical review of their food and\u00a0their service\u00a0she had written prior to being hired to work\u00a0with them\u00a0which they had felt publicly\u00a0humiliated by and\u00a0three employees who are Emilio's children in particular\u00a0strongly disliked\u00a0her.\n\nSomewhile later, his children and the other employees stop harassing Monica.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Monica's Work]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
