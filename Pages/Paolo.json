He was portrayed by [[Cosimo Fusco]].\n\n==History==\nPaolo is first introduced in \"[[The One With The Blackout]]\", while Rachel is trying to find the owner of a cat that got scared and ended up scratching [[Ross Geller|Ross]]. Paolo lived in the same building as Rachel and [[Monica Geller|Monica]]. He speaks very little English and his relationship with Rachel starts as nothing more than a fling.\n\nRoss is extremely jealous of Paolo and makes fun of him behind his back every chance he gets (he took advantage of the fact that Paolo speaks little English by calling him a \"crap weasel\" to his face). Despite his jealousy and hypocrisy, Ross doesn't dare to admit his feelings to Rachel at that time, and he is consistently jealous of any man who is close to Rachel (at least for the first 10 years of the show).\n\nEventually Paolo makes a pass at [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] during a massage, consequently Rachel ending his relationship with him. He appears again in the [[Season 2|second season]], where Rachel sleeps with him because she felt depressed about Ross and [[Julie]]. When asked where she ran into him, she says, \"at his apartment.\" She later tells Ross that she and Paolo are not getting back together, admitting it was a mistake to sleep with him again.\n\n==Appearances==\n* \"[[The One With The Blackout]]\" (First appearance)\n* \"[[The One Where Nana Dies Twice]]\" (mentioned only)\n* \"[[The One With The Monkey]]\" (mentioned only)\n* \"[[The One With Mrs. Bing]]\"\n* \"[[The One With The Dozen Lasagnas]]\"\n* \"[[The One With Ross's New Girlfriend]]\"\n* \"[[The One Where Ross Finds Out]]\" (mentioned as 'Italian guy(s))\n* \"[[The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies]]\" (mentioned only)\n* \"[[The One With The Free Porn]]\" (mentioned only)\n* \"[[The One With Mac And C.H.E.E.S.E.]]\" (Appears in flashback)\n\n==Trivia==\n* In the Italian version, Paolo is called Pablo and is Spanish.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Non-Americans]]\n[[Category:Rachel's relationships]]\n[[Category:Residents of the Friends building]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]"}}}]}}}}
