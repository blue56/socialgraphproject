Zelner''' is [[Rachel Greene]]'s boss at [[Ralph Lauren Corporation]]. He was portrayed  by [[Steve Ireland]].\n\nRachel inadvertently kisses him during her job interview but still gets hired. He seems very timid and serious about his job at Ralph Lauren.\n\nHe also has a son, [[Ross Zelner]], who is interested in dinosaurs, which [[Ross Geller]] uses as an avenue to convince him to offer Rachel her job back when she's fired after being caught interviewing for a job with Gucci. He also thinks that Ross' (Geller) name is \"Ron\" and the latter doesn't correct him.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In \"[[The One Where Rachel Goes Back To Work]]\", he says that he would follow Ralph Lauren \"into hell\" before whispering \"Microphones...\" to [[Gavin Mitchell]]. \n* He has the same initials (R.Z.) as his son.\n\n\n==Appearances==\n\n* \"[[The One With Rachel's Inadvertent Kiss]]\" \n* \"[[The One With All The Candy]]\"\n* \"[[The One With The Tea Leaves]]\"\n* \"[[The One Where Rachel Goes Back To Work]]\"\n* \"[[The One With Princess Consuela]]\"\n* \"[[The One Where Estelle Dies]]\"\n\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Rachel's Work]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 9 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
