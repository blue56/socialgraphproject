He tells Ross that there was a break-in and Marcel was taken (along with a snowy egret, a two-toed sloth, and three hooded sweatshirts from the zoo gift shop) and that the story told to Ross is a big cover up because the zoo wants to avoid bad publicity. He tells Ross that the cover-up goes very high up, but is shocked to learn that Lipson knows.\n\nHis initial plan is to get Ross to bribe him, but he tells Ross everything he knows too soon, thus failing.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
