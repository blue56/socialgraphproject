After coming out as gay, Charles\u00a0divorced Chandler's mother [[Nora Tyler Bing]], and works as a drag artist in Las Vegas.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early Life===\n\n[[File:CharlesBing_back.jpg|thumb|left|140px|Charles and Nora announce their divorce to Chandler.]]\n\nCharles and Nora Bing told Chandler they were separating after Thanksgiving dinner. By that time \u2014 Chandler was nine years old \u2014 both Charles\u00a0and Nora had an affair with the pool boy, though Charles decided to leave Nora for him.\n\nSince then Charles\u00a0became a drag queen and even attended Chandler's high school swimming events dressed as a different starlet each time. Chandler mentions that Charles slept with a Mr. Garibaldi. <small>(\"[[The One With Chandler's Dad]]\")</small>\n\nCharles now has a show in Las Vegas entitled ''Viva Las Gay-gas'' and performs under the stage name \"Helena Handbasket\" at ''The Four Queens'', where Mr. Garibaldi accompanies the act at the piano. <small>(\"[[The One With The Embryos]]\")</small> Helena once put on a black cocktail dress and asked Ross up to a hotel room. Chandler mentions that his father's house lights up and blows bubbles, although this is likely a joke. <small>(\"[[The One With The Dollhouse]]\")</small>\n\n===[[Season 7]]===\nChandler and his father have long been estranged. Monica wants Chandler to invite his father to their wedding when Chandler reveals that they haven't spoken in years. Monica and Chandler fly out to Las Vegas to invite Charles to the wedding. Monica and Chandler catch one of Charles' shows (as Helena) and Helena isn't too happy with Chandler due to him frequently avoiding contact. Chandler indirectly apologizes for not trying to get in touch sooner and invites his father to the wedding, who accepts to go. <small>(\"[[The One With Chandler's Dad]]\")</small>\n\nHelena and Nora meet again for the first time in years at the wedding. They exchange a few words. Helena scathingly asks Nora if she isn't too old to wear a slutty dress and Nora asks if Helena doesn't have too much penis to wear a dress. <small>(\"[[The One With Monica And Chandler's Wedding, Part 1]]\")</small>\n\nHelena and Nora walk Chandler down the aisle and congratulate him on his big day. <small>(\"[[The One With Monica And Chandler's Wedding, Part 2]]\")</small>\n\n===[[Season 8]]===\n\nNora and Helena are sitting together at the reception and they are still upset with each other. <small>(\"[[The One After \"I Do\"]]\")</small>\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The One With The East German Laundry Detergent]]\" (First Mentioned)\n*\"[[The One With The Giant Poking Device]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One Without The Ski Trip]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With The Hypnosis Tape]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With The Dollhouse]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With The Embryos]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With All The Thanksgivings]]\" (First appearance) (Appears in flashback)\n*\"[[The One Where Ross Got High]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With Rachel's Big Kiss]] (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With Chandler's Dad]]\"\n*\"[[The One With Monica And Chandler's Wedding, Part 1]]\"\n*\"[[The One With Monica And Chandler's Wedding, Part 2]]\"\n*\"[[The One After \"I Do\"]]\"\n*\"[[The One Where Ross Is Fine]]\" (Mentioned only)\n\n==Trivia==\n*The actress who portrayed Charles/Helena, [[Kathleen Turner]], also voices Jessica Rabbit who, incidentally, is on Chandler's celebrity kiss list.
