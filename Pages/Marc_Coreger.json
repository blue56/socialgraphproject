At first the couple seems quite friendly and helpful but soon proves to be a little too eager about the process of birth. \n\nThey are so overly enthusiastic about pregnancies that it eventually creeps out both Rachel and Ross. \nInstances of this are when he takes pictures of Rachel having contractions and describing his wife's cervix in graphic detail. Soon after this, he and his wife get transferred to the delivery room leaving Rachel and Ross with a new couple. \n\nAfter they leave, Ross refers to them as \"The Disgustingtons.\"\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Season 8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
