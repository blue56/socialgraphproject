After Phoebe leaves Central Perk, he briefly discusses her porn films with [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]; leaving Joey shocked as he was unaware of Phoebe's \"secret career\". Though in truth, Phoebe is not a porn star but instead her sister Ursula works as one under Phoebe's name.\n\nIn the credits, Campbell is credited as \"The Fan\".\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Unidentified characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
