She was a big fan of Joey, and claimed that she used to schedule her classes to watch ''[[Days of Our Lives]]''. They went on a few dates before Joey broke up with her after he slept with Kate, and this caused Lauren to hate him and call him names such as \"pig\". Instead of performing\u00a0the scene with Kate, Joey\u00a0performed it with Lauren.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Joey's relationships]]\n[[Category:Joey's Work]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
