He was portrayed by [[Sam Anderson]].\n\nDr. Harad is depicted as having a strong obsession with the ''Happy Days'' character Arthur Fonzarelli,\u00a0to the point where\u00a0he would frequently, sometimes completely spontaneously,\u00a0bring up the Fonz in conversation, even when he is supposed to be comforting Phoebe while she is in labor. His\u00a0unsettling constant references to the Fonz\u00a0make Phoebe very uncomfortable in his presence and\u00a0she asks [[Ross Geller|Ross]] to find her a different doctor. The new doctor appears very young and Phoebe chases him away and decides to stick with Harad. Despite his Fonz obsession however, Harad ultimately proves himself to be a highly competent doctor who successfully delivers the triplets.\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
