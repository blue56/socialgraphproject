He had his own CD recorder and remote control. He was hired as a\u00a0striptease dancer who dressed as a policeman and went under the name Officer Goodbody\u00a0(his real name being\u00a0Roy) as they gave [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] a proper send off over Tea and Sandwiches.\n\n== Biography ==\nRoy is depicted as being very\u00a0delusional and sensitive\u00a0about his looks. Although he was presumably a handsome fellow once, given the initial success of his career as an exotic dancer, he had trouble coming to terms with the fact that he had not aged well and no longer had the looks or the body for exotic dancing,\u00a0and consequently convinced himself that Phoebe would enjoy watching him\u00a0perform. He got annoyed when she, while cringing, claimed that \"this is how I look when I'm turned on!\"\u00a0and then refused to allow a sympathetic [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] and [[Monica Geller|Monica]] to pay him despite the difficult, rushed journey on his part because she had forgotten to ask them to hire a dancer until the very last minute, and then he\u00a0got upset and\u00a0burst into tears when\u00a0she later\u00a0rather crudely insulted him over his age and current body contours. He was also upset partly because exotic dancing was all he knew and he therefore had no interest in or desire for doing anything else, until Phoebe suggested he teach exotic dancing to younger, more attractive gentlemen who wished to learn the craft. Though he cheered up upon hearing this suggestion, he was still sad that he would never be able to perform at parties himself again, so Phoebe, in her guilt after upsetting him earlier, told him he was welcome to perform one last time for her. It is implied that he had a heart attack or ran out of breath and passed out because it is mentioned that Phoebe had to drive him to the hospital.\n\nRoy mentioned having a nephew who he had\u00a0borrowed his police officer\u00a0costume from, which he admitted doing\u00a0after Phoebe correctly guessed that\u00a0it was a child's Halloween costume.\n\nRoy lives with his mother.\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
