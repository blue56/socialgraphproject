His relatively calm demeanor when he and Phoebe met for the first time at the dry-cleaner's is consistent with the hypo-manic phase of the syndrome. Phoebe had enjoyed his company and never found him to be'' too'' enthusiastic prior to the night he accompanied her to the party, which suggests\u00a0that he isn't always so over-excited about everything. He may have been nervous about going to a place he'd never been to before and being surrounded by so many people he'd never met before, or might have been drinking (offscreen).\n\n==Trivia==\n*Parker's portrayer, [[Alec Baldwin]], was mentioned by [[Ross Geller|Ross]] in \"[[The One With Rachel's Crush]]\" (S4E13).\n*Apparently, the character was based on a real life boyfriend of one of the creators.\n* 2 ''Friends'' regulars guest-starred in the TV series ''30 Rock'' with Alec Baldwin among the main cast:\n** [[David Schwimmer]] appeared in a 2007 episode [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenzo Greenzo] (S02E05).\n** [[Jennifer Aniston]] appeared in a 2008 episode (S03E03). Aniston's character on 30 Rock had a similar behavior as Parker on ''Friends'', she was energetic, enthusiast, hyperactive and hypersexual, obsessed over Baldwin's character who found her addictive and with his friends disapproving of her. The ''30 Rock'' episode was named [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_One_with_the_Cast_of_Night_Court \"The One with the Cast of Night Court\"] as a callback to all Friends' episode titles that begin with \"The One With...\".  For her performance in that episode Aniston was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's relationships]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
