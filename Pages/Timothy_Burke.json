He is also the brother of [[Michelle Burke]] and the uncle of Michelle's son Henry. He appeared in the [[season 4]] episode \"[[The One With Chandler In A Box]]\", portrayed by [[Michael Vartan]].\n\nTimothy Burke substituted as [[Monica Geller|Monica's]] eye doctor while his\u00a0father was\u00a0out of town. Monica invited Timothy to have [[Thanksgiving]] with the group. She was attracted to him, while her friends all thought it was weird. When they kissed however, Timothy reminded Monica of Richard. (In a deleted scene, Timothy said Monica reminded him of a younger version of his mom.) Both of them were very disturbed by this, and\u00a0ultimately decided against attempting a relationship.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 4 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Monica's relationships]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
