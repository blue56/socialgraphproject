When he informs Chandler that there will be models coming over from time to time and that he spends most of the weekends at the beach house of his sister, a porn star, where Chandler is welcome too, Chandler decides that Eric will be his new roommate in lieu of [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]. However, just as Eric is about to move in with Chandler, he encounters Chandler's neighbor\u00a0[[Mr Heckles]] in the hallway, who for some unexplained reason tells Eric that ''HE ''is Chandler's new roommate, and he sent Eric away before wandering into Chandler's room, much to Chandler's shock. When Eric didn't arrive, Chandler, failing to realize that Heckles had sent him away prior to wandering into his room, angrily\u00a0assumed he simply hadn't bothered to turn up and accepted Joey as his new roommate instead. After being sent away by Heckles, Eric is never seen again.\n\nJohn Lehr later appeared in ''Jesse ''with [[Christina Applegate]] who played [[Amy Green]] in season 9/10.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
