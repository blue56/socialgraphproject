What it was is unknown, though the two things Chandler alludes to: \"the thing we hardly do\" and \"the thing we never do\", but apparently [[Monica Geller|Monica]] and Chandler never do it themselves, prompting Chandler to be rather impressed with 'Shovelly Joe'.\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
