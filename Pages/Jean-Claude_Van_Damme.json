He is well known for starring in action films such as ''The Expendables 2'', ''Street Fighter ''and ''JCVD.''\n\n==Role on Friends==\nJean-Claude plays a fictional version of himself as an actor on the set of the fictional movie ''Outbreak 2''.\n\nWhen [[Monica Geller|Monica]] and [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] visit the set of ''Outbreak 2'' with [[Ross Geller|Ross]] to visit [[Marcel]] they soon spot Jean-Claude Van Damme roaming the set. Monica is attracted to Jean-Claude but is too shy to go up to it. Rachel takes the initiative and resolves to go up to Jean-Claude to ask him out for Monica.\n\nTurns out our hunky actor only has eye for Rachel and she ends up accepting the date instead of Monica. Monica originally says this is okay, but later has a change of heart and she and Rachel get into a fight. After [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] calms them both down Rachel agrees to let Monica go out with him instead.\n\nMonica heads out with Jean-Claude only to find out that the only reason Jean-Claude agreed to go out with her is because Rachel told him Monica would have a threesome with him and Drew Barrymore. Monica refuses and the girls get into another fight later in the episode. \n\nIn a deleted scene, when Jean-Claude says goodbye to Rachel and Monica, he tells Monica that Drew was disappointed about not doing the threesome and Jean-Claude wondered if Rachel and Monica would consider having a threesome with him. When they refuse, he defends with, \"You sure? I can crush a walnut with my butt.\" They still refuse, and Monica says that it is impressive though.\n\nAt the end of the episode, he and everyone else on the studio set are both annoyed and bemused by Joey's stupidity throughout the shooting of the film.\n\n==History==\nJean-Claude Van Damme (born October 18, 1960) is a Belgian martial artist, and actor who is best known for his large catalogue of action movies. His Belgian background combined with his physique gave rise to his nickname The Muscles from Brussels. Van Damme has also been called the \"King of the Belgians\" due to his international superstardom.\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monica's relationships]]\n[[Category:Rachel's relationships]]\n[[Category:Non-Americans]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Actors]]\n[[Category:One appearance Only Cast]]\n[[Category:Actors playing themselves]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
