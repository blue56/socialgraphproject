Joey dated her in the period just prior to the show's timeline.\n\nIn \"[[The One With The East German Laundry Detergent]]\", Joey meets a former girlfriend named Angela and tries to get her back. Her last name is not mentioned, she may or may not be the same Angela Delveccio. She was portrayed by [[Kim Gillingham]].\n\n== Character ==\nThroughout the series, Angela Delveccio is mentioned three times. Chandler tells Joey that their kitchen table was fine until his \"little breakfast adventure\" with her.<ref>\"[[The One With The Dozen Lasagnas]]\"</ref> A few years later Chandler asks Joey what he gave Angela for birthday presents. Joey responds that she didn't have a birthday while they were going out, to which Chandler replies \"For three years?\"<ref name=\":1\">\"[[The One With The Dirty Girl]]\"</ref> This proves that they had a long-term relationship.\n\nJoey runs into Angela at [[Central Perk]], where she reveals herself to be dating a man named [[Bob]]. Joey proposes that he and [[Monica Geller|Monica]] go on a double date, intending to break up Angela and Bob and take Angela for himself<ref name=\":0\">\"[[The One With The East German Laundry Detergent]]\"</ref>.\n\nThough it's not officially stated that Angela Delveccio is the same one we see onscreen in \"[[The One With The East German Laundry Detergent]]\", there is no evidence that it is not her. Even though Joey dates a lot of women, it seems unlikely that he would have two ex-girlfriends named Angela within the span of a few months.\n\nAt the end of \"[[The One With The East German Laundry Detergent]]\", Joey and Angela get back together, but probably split up again soon afterward, as she is never seen in the series again.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Angela grew up in Brooklyn Heights.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* She and Joey dated for 3 years before the series started.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Joey's relationships]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
