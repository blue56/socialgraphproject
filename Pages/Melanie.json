She wants to have sex with him, but Joey can't because he's participating in a research study in which he donates sperm for money.\u00a0Joey keeps postponing sex with Melanie by doing other sexual things that please her only. This makes Melanie even crazier about Joey, and she quite literally fills his and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]]'s [[Joey's Apartment|apartment]] with fruit baskets in gratitude. Joey is also having fun pleasing Melanie, which he points out to Chandler is something he doesn't usually do.
