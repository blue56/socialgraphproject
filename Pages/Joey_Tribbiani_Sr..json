He was portrayed by [[Robert Costanzo]].\n\nHe owns a pipe fitting business and lives with his wife [[Gloria Tribbiani|Gloria]] on Staten Island. Both appeared in the episode \"[[The One With The Boobies]]\". Joey, Sr. is also conducting a long-term extra-marital affair with a pet mortician named [[Ronni Rapalono]]. Although Joey disapproves of this state of affairs, he is forced to accept it when his mother reminds him how much happier his father is now that he has a \"hobby\", and that their marriage is much better due to Joey, Sr.'s shame.\n\nJoey, Sr. also appeared in an episode of ''[[Joey (TV Series)|Joey]]'', \"[[Joey and the Dad]]\", in which he flew to L.A. to attend the premiere of Joey's movie ''Captured''.\n\n==Appearance==\nJoey, Sr. looks like a regular middle-aged man; he is average height, is a little chubby, and his head is almost completely bald. He is quite tanned, which signifies his Italian descent. \n\n==Trivia==\n*[[Robert Costanzo]] is the only actor besides [[Matt LeBlanc]] to appear on both ''[[Friends]]'' and ''[[Joey (TV Series)|Joey]]'' as the same character. (Some characters, such as [[Gina Tribbiani]] appeared on both shows, but not played by the same actor, while some actors, such as [[Adam Goldberg]] and [[Jennifer Coolidge]] appeared on both shows, but not as the same character).\n[[Category:Joey's Family]]\n[[Category:Grandfathers]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Joey Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Joey Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 7 Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
