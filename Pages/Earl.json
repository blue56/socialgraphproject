When she asks why he has rejected her offer, the bitter Earl replies that he doesn't need any toner because he's \"going to kill (himself)\" He goes on to say that he's stuck in a meaningless, dead-end job and no one even knows he exists.\n\nWhen Earl hangs up on her, Phoebe decides to go down to\u00a0his office in person to try and convince him not to kill himself.\u00a0When she does, it\u00a0soon becomes clear to her that\u00a0the\u00a0ignorance\u00a0of him displayed by the people in his life around him is driving Earl crazy.\u00a0Trying to convince him not to kill himself, Phoebe uses her mother's suicide as proof that she \"knows about this kind of stuff\" and tells Earl it's fate that connected her and him. She then offers some \"similarities\" between Earl and her mom [[Lily Buffay|Lily]] (though they weren't actually similarities so much as they were stretched truth and lies). Phoebe even tells Earl that her mom's name was Pearl (P-Earl). Earl appears to absorb Phoebe's words when she tells him that he doesn't need any of his uncaring co-workers to pay attention to him-but when he loudly announces this to them all and they ignore him completely, not even looking at him, he can't help but express to Phoebe that he'd like a ''little'' bit of attention from them. He is never seen again after this, but considering his\u00a0apparent newfound friendship with Phoebe, which would presumably\u00a0have diminished the feelings of loneliness that drove him crazy and caused him to feel suicidal,\u00a0it is safe to assume that she was successful in her attempts to convince him not to kill himself.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Jason Alexander made an appearance in an episode of ''Friends''. [[Courteney Cox]]\u00a0earlier made an appearance\u00a0in an episode of ''Seinfeld''. Both are prominent sitcoms based in New York.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 7 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Mentally Ill Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
