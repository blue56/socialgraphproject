In an odd coincidence, Tony had at some point prior to this conversation built a canoe, which Peter, for some\u00a0reason that was never explained,\u00a0had become desperate to get rid of in the same sort of way that Chandler was at this point\u00a0desperate to get rid of the entertainment unit.\u00a0Peter tries to convince Chandler to trade the unit for their canoe. Tony refuses this deal, exclaiming \"I built that canoe!\" and storms out, creating a parallel between the two of them and Chandler and Joey.\n\n[[Image:4x02 Canoe Promo.jpg|thumb|left|Chandler and Joey in the canoe.]]\nEventually, Chandler and Joey do end up taking the canoe from Tony and Peter after their apartment is robbed.
