He appears to have a bizarre fetish for women making salad, as he apparently began to have an orgasm after asking Monica to make him a salad and describe what she was doing to him as she did it.\n\nAt some point during the many years that took place between this episode of  Friends and the ''Joey'' episode \"[[Joey and the Wrong Name]]\", the manager apparently quit his job (or may have been sacked for sexual harassment, given his perverted nature) and got into show business, and by the time he met [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]], he had became a successful film producer.\u00a0He is furious when Joey\u00a0presents\u00a0an award for Best Supporting Actress at the Daytime Soap Awards to the wrong\u00a0person (after saying the actress' name twice, really just because he was delighted that he had finally pronounced her name correctly) and threatens to have him banned from all Turner Broadcasting System award shows.\n\nThe character's name is never revealed at any point in either episode -- actor [[Patrick Kerr]] is credited as \"The Restaurant Manager\" in \"[[The One With The Prom Video]]\", and \"The Producer\" in \"[[Joey and the Wrong Name]]\". Since the characters are portrayed by the same actor however, it is safe to assume they are the same person.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Joey Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
