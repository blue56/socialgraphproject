She was portrayed by [[Clea Lewis]].\n\nIn \"[[The Pilot]]\", she told Monica that she had also\u00a0had sex with [[Paul the Wine Guy]], and claimed he had told her that he hadn't been able to perform sexually since his wife had left him two years prior to this happening. Since he had told Monica exactly the same thing prior to sleeping with her, she realized he had been lying. That line he used is a clever scheme to get women to sleep with him.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Monica's Work]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
