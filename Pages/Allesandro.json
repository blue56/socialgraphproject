She then shows him how she personally cooks tomato sauce and impresses him, earning his reluctant respect. He is from Lebanon, which he reveals when Monica asks him: \"You own an Italian restaurant and you don't know food? Where are you from, anyway?\" He replies: \"Lebanon\". He decides to hire Monica as his new head chef at his restaurant, and gives his original head chef the sack. His final onscreen appearance is in\u00a0the final scene of the episode, where he\u00a0introduces Monica to his employees, who\u00a0strongly dislike\u00a0her partly\u00a0because of the critical and humiliating review, and partly because of the fact that Allesandro sacked Chef Emilio, who was literally\u00a0family to some of the\u00a0employees.\n\nWhile the actor Taylor Negron was openly gay, there is no reference of the sexuality of his character Allesandro.\n[[Category:Season 4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monica's Work]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
