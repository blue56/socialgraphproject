Chandler thinks she is Mary-Angela, and rejects her. Mary-Angela enters almost immediately after he asks Mary-Therese which one Mary-Angela is.\n\n== On Joey ==\nIn ''[[Joey (TV Series)|Joey]]'', Mary-Therese has been renamed '''Mary-Theresa''' and has virtually no similarities to the Mary-Therese in ''Friends''. She is Joey's second youngest sister and extremely spoiled. She is seen in only one episode, [[Joey and the Fancy Sister]].\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Joey's Family]]\n[[Category:Characters played by different actors]]\n[[Category:Joey Characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Joey Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
