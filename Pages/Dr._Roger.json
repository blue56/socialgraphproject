He is played by [[Pat Finn]].\n\n[[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] think he is boring, Monica thinks he is \"low-key\", and a good person. He often receives beep messages from the hospital and has to leave.\n\nWhen Monica has prepared a romantic dinner with oysters and couscous she considers sensual and aphrodisiac, Dr. Roger receives a message and leaves for an emergency. Then Chandler comes to eat the food and Monica, who is embarrassed to still be a virgin, convinces him to help her by having sex with her, twice.\n\nOn their next date, Dr. Roger receives another emergency beep and leaves. Chandler walks in and tells Monica that he beeped Dr. Roger because he wants to be with Monica, and they kiss.\n\nDr. Roger is probably a surgical resident, as he leaves after an emergency \"ruptured spleen\" message.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Monica's relationships]]\n[[Category:Doctors]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
