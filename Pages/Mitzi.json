She is a bully to [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] and the second female antagonist to appear in the series. The first one is [[Nurse Sizemore]].\n\nShe first meets Rachel in a laundromat when she steals\u00a0the latter's\u00a0machine and loads her own clothing into it,\u00a0using\u00a0the excuse that there weren't any clothes in it in order to win the argument with her. Rachel is unable to stand up to her at first, but [[Ross Geller]], who is with her, does. He wins the argument and Mitzi withdraws her clothes from the machine.\n\n[[File:Ross-horrible-woman.png|thumb|220x220px|Ross confronting Mitzi]]\nLater, all of Rachel's white clothes have turned pink because of a red sock. Mitzi walks past, peeking into the washing machine. She smirks wickedly at her. Sniggering with vain happiness, Mitzi walks on.\n\nMitzi is finally seen when Rachel leaves her cart nearby and the big bully attempts to steal it from her, using the excuse that there wasn't any clothes in it, again.\u00a0Rachel\u00a0wins the argument this time\u00a0by jumping into the cart. Outsmarted, Mitzi slinks away.\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
