Not long after, Chandler gives up and jokes that Ross was dating a character from Fraggle Rock.\n\nOn Ross and Elizabeth's date, Ross wears a pair of extremely tight leather pants that stick to his legs from his sweat. He goes to the bathroom to get some air, but cannot pull his pants back up. He spends the majority of his date in the bathroom trying to find a way to pull his pants back up, with no success. Elizabeth knocks on the door and Ross walks out, leather pants in hand. The two never go on a second date.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In [[Season 6|season six]] Ross dates a student from his class, also named [[Elizabeth Stevens|Elizabeth]].\n\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Ross' relationships]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
