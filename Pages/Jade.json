Hearing that she takes aerobics, that her legs were on the latest James Bond poster, and that she enjoys partying, Chandler takes advantage of this and ends up dating her by arranging a date with 'Bob' that will never happen so that he can meet her instead, giving her Ross' number to avoid her learning the truth.
