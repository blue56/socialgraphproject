Now that I've touched you, you seem emptier still.|''The Empty Vase'' by Julio.}}\n'''Julio''' is an amateur poet and one of [[Monica Geller|Monica]]'s fellow workers at the [[Moondance Diner]], who she falls for in \"[[The One With All The Jealousy]]\". They share a kiss, and she shows the guys a poem he wrote when he was with her called ''The Empty Vase''. [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] interprets the poem as Julio using the empty vase of the title as a metaphor to express contempt for Monica; ''\"My vessel so empty with nothing inside. Now that I\u2019ve touched you, you seem emptier still\".''\n\nAn outraged Monica remonstrates with him, but Julio explains that Phoebe's interpretation is wrong. Just as she's about to apologize, Julio explains that ''The Empty Vase'' is about ''all'' women - ''\"well, all American women\"''. Monica dumps Julio and sends a barber shop quartet to the diner to sing him an insulting break up song - ''\"Mister Pretentious, you think there\u2019s no one finer, but your poems are unpublished, and you work in a diner. You\u2019re no God's gift to women, that\u2019s all in your headdddd. You are just a buttmunch - no one likes a buttmunch - and you\u2019re also bad in be-e-e-edd\".''\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The One With All The Jealousy]]\" (First appearance)\n*\"[[The One With The Hypnosis Tape]]\" (Mentioned only)\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monica's Work]]\n[[Category:Monica's relationships]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
