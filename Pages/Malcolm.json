It quickly becomes clear that Malcolm has an unhealthy obsession with Ursula which is making him \"[[Obsessive Love|love drunk]],\" but Phoebe\u00a0seemingly helps him get over\u00a0this and starts dating him - until she learns that he actually isn't cured of his obsession after all and is still stalking Ursula. Phoebe ends it with Malcolm because it is too weird but offers to help him get over Ursula. She even suggests that he stalk her for a while - which he immediately does.\n\nAlthough Ursula made further appearances in the show, Malcolm was never seen again after this episode. From this it is safe to assume that Malcolm eventually did get over his obsession with Ursula and stop stalking her.\n\n==Trivia==\n* Malcom is portrayed by [[David Arquette]], who was [[Courteney Cox]]'s boyfriend by the time \"[[The One With The Jam]]\" aired, and they then married in 1999.\n* He is the first guy to date both [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] and [[Ursula Buffay|Ursula]], the second being [[Eric]]. Both of them, when seeing Phoebe for the first time, mistake her for Ursula.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's relationships]]\n[[Category:Mentally Ill Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
