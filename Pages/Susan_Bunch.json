She is played by [[Jessica Hecht]]. Carol and Susan get married in \"[[The One With The Lesbian Wedding]]\".\n\n==Background==\nSusan is revealed to be a vegetarian in \"[[The One With The Dozen Lasagnas]]\". She works in advertising.\n\nSusan and Carol had an affair while Carol was married to Ross. Ross and Susan do not initially get along very well, mainly because Ross resents Susan for \"stealing\" Carol away from him. Susan resents Ross for his romantic history with Carol as well as his awkward behavior around her. In \"[[The One With The Sonogram At The End]]\", they want to give Ross and Carol's unborn child the surname Willick-Bunch, excluding Ross from the title. During Carol's labor in \"[[The One With The Birth]]\", Ross and Susan even manage to compete in who fetches Carol some ice chips, resulting in Carol banishing them both from the delivery room. During their argument in the janitor's closet, the two agree with Phoebe's musing that Carol is giving birth to a baby that has three parents that truly care for it. Spurred on by this and the name tag on the uniform Phoebe wears, the two decide to name the child [[Ben Geller|Ben]].\n\nCarol and Susan announce their plans to get married in \"[[The One With The Lesbian Wedding]]\", but Carol's parents refuse to attend the wedding, leading Carol to doubt her decision. Ross initially hesitant to see his ex-wife remarry, finds himself in the position of being the one to encourage her to go ahead with the ceremony despite her parents' opposition. At the reception, Susan thanks Ross for his part in saving the wedding, and offers to dance with him; he first declines the offer, but later agrees. Apparently, this resolved their strained relationship.\n\nSusan's [[Mr. Bunch|father]] appears to be in the military and both her parents seem very supportive and accepting of her relationship with Carol, specifically stating that while there is a Mother's Day, following her wedding to Carol.\n\nCarol and Susan celebrated their anniversary together (although not the wedding anniversary) in \"[[The One Without The Ski Trip]]\".\n\nHer final appearance was in the [[The One That Could Have Been, Part 2|alternate reality episode]] of [[Season 6]] where it is implied that no matter what Ross and Carol would not end up together. The mothers, Carol and Susan, are still together today in many other episodes and stories.\n\n===Future===\nIn a 2019 interview, the actress [[Jane Sibbett]] (who portrayed Carol) believed Carol and Susan had moved to London and frequently worry about Ben while he is in college ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JmGYlMwh2E source]). As to compensate that fear, they adopt children and home-school them.
