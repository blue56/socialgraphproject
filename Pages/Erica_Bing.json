She and her twin brother Jack were adopted from a young woman, also named [[Erica]], living in Ohio.\n\n[[File:Jack_and_Erica.png|thumb|left|Erica (held by Chandler)]]\n\nJack and Erica were born in the [[The Last One|series finale]]. Monica and Chandler were unaware at the time of their birth that they would be receiving twins and Monica had to calm Chandler down at first. Erica was second to be born and therefore the unexpected baby.\n\nErica was named after her biological mother, [[Erica]], although both Erica and [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] appeared not to fully register Chandler and Monica's reasons for choosing that name for her: When Monica and Chandler tell Erica that they are naming their daughter after her she responds \"Oh My God! That's just like my name!\". When Joey learns her name, he says \"Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.\" Chandler responded with \"It's a shame you two didn't spend much time together!\"\n\n==Trivia==\n*According to Monica, she had wanted to name her daughter Emma since she was fourteen, but she ended up letting Rachel have the name two years prior to becoming a mother herself when Rachel had trouble finding a name for her [[Emma Geller-Greene|daughter]] on her own.\n*Erica was named after her biological mother, similarly to another adopted character, [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]], who was also named after her biological mother. Both characters were born as twins.\n*Erica will be {{AgeCalc|2004-05-06}}.\n[[Category:Chandler's Family]]\n[[Category:Ross & Monica's Family]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Multiple Birth Characters]]\n[[Category:Twins]]\n[[Category:Adopted Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
