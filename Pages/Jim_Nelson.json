He was portrayed by [[James LeGros]] in the episode \"[[The One With The Tea Leaves]]\".\n\nJim and Phoebe met by seeing each other everywhere while out on their errands and eventually he decided to ask Phoebe out on a date, despite being slightly bemused when she misunderstood the pretty obvious meaning of a remark he made. On the date, Jim\u00a0fell away from his initially polite and friendly demeanor and, seemingly just to amuse himself, started\u00a0making highly inappropriate comments which Phoebe found disturbing. \n\nHe claimed that he wrote \"erotic novels for children\" which were \"wildly unpopular\". He also said that he had a PhD which for him stands for (looking down at his crotch) \"pretty huge d...\" (cut by Phoebe). \n\nPhoebe later referred to him as the \"rude guy\".\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 8 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's relationships]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
