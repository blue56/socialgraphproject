Better roommate than you!'''</center>\n|4 = Chandler describing Eddie as a roommate\n}}\n'''Eddie Menuek''' is Chandler's roommate, portrayed by [[Adam Goldberg]]. He appeared in 3 episodes: \"[[The One Where Eddie Moves In]]\", \"[[The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies]]\" and \"[[The One Where Eddie Won't Go]]\".\n\nEddie moved in with [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] when [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] moved into his own spacious apartment, after he got a job as [[Dr. Drake Ramoray]] on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', earning a high salary. Chandler and Eddie met at the supermarket where Eddie helped Chandler pick out a chorizo. Chandler later discovers they have nothing in common; Eddie hates ''Baywatch'', foosball and sports, steals mannequins from Macy's and dehydrates fruit for fun. Chandler then meets Eddie's ex-girlfriend [[Tilly]], who Eddie claims \"ripped out my heart and smeared it all over my life\", when she drops off Eddie's old, empty goldfish tank. Eddie, however, seeing Tilly and the empty tank, believes that Chandler slept with her and then killed his fish. Eddie replaces the fish with a Goldfish cracker, which he names Chandler. He later replaces it with a real goldfish and ends up shoving it in his pocket and storming out the door after a fight with Chandler.\n\nAfter Chandler has a few confrontations with Eddie, who steals the insoles from his shoes to spite him for the imagined affair, Chandler decides Eddie must go - the final provocative act for this being Eddie watching Chandler sleep every night, which a shocked Chandler discovers upon waking one night. Chandler suspects that Eddie may be mentally ill, which is confirmed when he not only repeatedly forgets that Chandler ordered him to move out, but also imagines that he and Chandler had once taken a trip to Las Vegas and believes it to have really happened. In the end, Chandler uses Eddie's mental illness against him when he moves all of Eddie's possessions out of his room, leaving them at the bottom of the stairs, changes the lock on his door so that Eddie's keys don't work, and when he answers the door to Eddie, pretends that he doesn't know him, acting like he had never lived with Chandler at all in the first place. Joey, who Chandler asks to replace Eddie as Chandler's new roommate, is also in the room when Chandler answers the door to Eddie and claims that he, not Eddie, had been living with Chandler for the past few days. Eddie's mental illness causes him to believe that this must be the truth, so he finally leaves Chandler alone. He is never seen again.\n\nEddie suffered from various mental and emotional problems, as demonstrated by him forgetting things happening, such as Chandler telling him to move out several times, and replacing them with other events, such as himself and Chandler going to Las Vegas.\n\n\n\n[[File:Eddie_gif.gif|thumb|Eddie's Locked Out!]]\n\n==Trivia==\n* Adam Goldberg later appeared in the spin-off ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]'', as [[Michael Tribbiani|Michael]]'s father, [[Jimmy Costa]].\n\n== Appearances ==\n* \"[[The One Where Eddie Moves In]]\" (First Appearance)\n* \"[[The One Where Dr. Ramoray Dies]]\"\n* \"[[The One Where Eddie Won't Go]]\" (Final Appearance)\n* \"[[The One Where Old Yeller Dies]]\" (Mentioned Only)\n\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Residents of the Friends building]]\n[[Category:Mentally Ill Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
