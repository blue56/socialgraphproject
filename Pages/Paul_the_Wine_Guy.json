He appeared in \"[[The Pilot]]\", portrayed by [[John Allen Nelson]].\n\nHe worked in a restaurant with Monica and she had probably told her friends about him prior to the episode\u00a0since they all referred to him as \"Paul the Wine Guy\". They went out for dinner, but Monica insisted it wasn't a date, just \"two people going to dinner, and not having sex,\" to which Chandler responded by saying \"Sounds like a date to me.\"\u00a0On the date, Paul claimed that\u00a0\"Since my wife left me, I haven't been able to perform... sexually\". They ended up having sex. However, [[Franny]], a co-worker of Monica's who had previously slept with Paul, has been told exactly the same thing-it was a line Paul used in a clever scheme to get women to\u00a0sleep with him. When Monica\u00a0discovered this after\u00a0a casual conversation with the co-worker in question, she\u00a0angrily breaks Paul's watch with her foot.\n\nIt is never explained why he is called \"the Wine Guy\". Phoebe even asks Chandler\u00a0\"What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or he just complains a lot?\" but she doesn't receive an answer, as Chandler doesn't know.\n\n==Trivia==\n*Paul is mentioned again in \"[[The One Where Eddie Won't Go]]\" (S2E19) when Monica, [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]], and [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] are taking a \"goddess\" quiz from the book ''[[Be Your Own Windkeeper]]''. Phoebe scolds Monica for letting \"a guy into the forest of [her] righteous truth on the first date!\n*One can say that the one line he uses to get women to sleep and make out with him is similar to [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey's]], \"How You Doin'\" in which normally leads to him making out and sleeping with a women as well. Another similarity both guys have is that they both normally have one-night stands with their date.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Monica's relationships]]\n[[Category:A to Z]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]"}}}]}}}}
