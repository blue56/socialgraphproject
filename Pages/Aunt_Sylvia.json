They strongly dislike her. She's referenced three times at the show, but is never seen:\n* In \"[[The One With The Dozen Lasagnas]]\", she orders 12 lasagnas from Monica, but is irritated when they have meat in them, although she apparently didn't mention to Monica that she wanted vegetarian lasagnas.\n* In \"[[The One Where Old Yeller Dies]]\", [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] tries to grow a mustache like [[Richard Burke|Richard]]. The sight of Chandler with a hairy upper lip reminds Monica and Ross of Sylvia, which strongly implies she has a mustache too.\n* In \"[[The One With The Dollhouse]]\", she dies. When Monica hears the news, she reacts by punching the air with joy, as it turns out that Sylvia was, in Monica's words \"a cruel, cranky old bitch.\" Monica\u00a0acquires a\u00a0dollhouse that had belonged to Sylvia, which she never let anyone play with.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Ross & Monica's Family]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]"}}}]}}}}
