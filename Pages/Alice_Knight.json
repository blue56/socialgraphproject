She claims that he was her best student. He claims that she was his best teacher. Although they both claim to have pure love, they lust for each other easily, including in public places such as coffee houses or hospitals.\n\nPhoebe disapproved of their relationship due to the age gap between the two (26 years), and bemused them both with her daft comments during her attempts to split them up. Eventually however, she came to accept their relationship.\n\nIn the show she is only referred to as Alice Knight. After she and Frank Buffay Jr. married, it is unknown if Alice kept her last name, or legally changed it to Buffay or Knight-Buffay.\n\nShe and Frank cannot conceive due to Alice's age, so they ask Phoebe to carry the embryo, which she agrees to do. In \"[[The One Hundredth]]\", Phoebe had triplets: [[Leslie Buffay|Leslie]], [[Frank Buffay Jr. Jr.|Frank Jr. Jr.]], and [[Chandler Buffay|Chandler]].\n\n== Media ==\n* [https://ew.com/tv/2019/09/21/friends-debra-jo-rupp-alice Why Debra Jo Rupp was 'horrified' during her first Friends episode \u2014 and how the show changed her life] (Entertainment Weekly, September 2019)\n\n== Episodes ==\n* \"[[The One With The Hypnosis Tape]]\"\n* \"[[The One With Phoebe's Uterus]]\"\n* \"[[The One With The Embryos]]\"\n* \"[[The One With The Free Porn]]\"\n* \"[[The One With Rachel's New Dress]]\"\n* \"[[The One Hundredth]]\"\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Mothers]]\n[[Category:Season 3 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's Family]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Divorcees]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
