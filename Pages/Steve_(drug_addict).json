He is portrayed by [[Jon Lovitz]].\n\n==Appearances==\nIn \"[[The One With The Stoned Guy]]\", [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] introduces [[Monica Geller|Monica]] to Steve, one of her massage clients, because he is a restaurateur looking for a new chef. Monica prepares a gourmet meal for him, but when he shows up, Phoebe reveals that he lit up a joint on the ride over and is now stoned. Steve acts like a fool, attempting to eat taco shells from Monica's cupboard and spilling gummy bears into a bowl and then tells Monica to call 911. Eventually, he tries to eat a kitchen magnet and Monica is forced to take him to the emergency room, where she leaves him.\n\nSteve does not appear again until the [[Season 9]] episode \"[[The One With The Blind Dates]]\", where Phoebe deliberately sets [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] up on a bad blind date with him in hopes that she will get back together with [[Ross Geller|Ross]].
