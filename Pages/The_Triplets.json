[[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] was the surrogate mother, giving birth to them in \"[[The One Hundredth]]\". \n\nFrank Jr. Jr. is named after his father, [[Frank Buffay Jr.]], Alice named Leslie. Chandler was named after [[Chandler Bing]], even though the baby was actually a girl. \n\nWhen the triplets turned five, they became very active and rowdy. They were unaware that Phoebe was their surrogate mother until a later episode, where Chandler Bing accidentally reveals it to the triplets, and when they stare at him in bewilderment, he quickly leaves the coffee shop,\u00a0quipping that he will now \"tell Emma she was an accident.\"\n\n{{CharQuote|'''[[Alice Knight|Alice]]''' (''to Phoebe''): Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank Jr. Jr. <br/>\n'''[[Chandler Bing|Chandler]]''': Wouldn't that be Frank the III?<br/>\n'''Alice''': Don't get me started.<br/>\n|4=Alice Buffay and Chandler in \"[[The One With Rachel's New Dress]]\"\n}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"80\" orientation=\"square\" spacing=\"small\">\n160px-5x03 Phoebe and Triplets.jpg|Phoebe and the triplets\nFrank Jr. Jr.jpg|Frank Jr. Jr.\nLeslie Buffay.jpg|Leslie\nChandler Buffay.jpg|Chandler\nDr Harad and Chandler Buffay.png|Dr Harad and baby Chandler\nChandler with baby.png|Chandler with baby\nMonica with baby.png|Monica with baby\nBuffay triplets.png|The Triplets\nLeslie Buffay in a drawer.png|Leslie\nPhoebe babysitting the triplets.png|Phoebe babysitting the triplets\n</gallery>\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's Family]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Triplets]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
