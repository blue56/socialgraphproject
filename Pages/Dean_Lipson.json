Then he got a little better... but then he died.\" Lipson is later revealed to be lying, however.\n\nLater a [[The Zoo Employee|janitor]] tells Ross that he knows the true whereabouts of Marcel. He informs him that there was a break-in and he was taken (along with a snowy egret, a two-toed sloth, and three hooded sweatshirts from the zoo gift shop) and that the story told to Ross is a big cover up because the zoo wants to avoid bad publicity.\n\nDean Lipson leaves Ross with the saying \"sometimes monkeys die\" which he states is \"not a great saying\" but \"certainly fitting today\" and zoo dollars.\n\nLipson appears to be a very nervous person, who has a tendency to impulsively say ridiculous things while trying to remain calm and tell lies.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]"}}}]}}}}
