He is seen four times: the first time Rachel wants to quit, but she changes her mind when she has [[Joshua Burgin|Joshua]] as one of her clients. The second time, he sees Joshua's behind and smiles. The third time when he tells Rachel that Joshua left his billfold and the fourth and final time when he asks Rachel to go with [[Emily Waltham|Emily]], his niece from England who was in New York, to ''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_Fledermaus Die Fledermaus]'', an operetta. Because Rachel has a date with Joshua that evening, she asks [[Ross Geller|Ross]] to go with Emily, which finally results in them getting married. He isn't seen at the wedding.\n\n==Trivia==\n*It is likely he is appreciative of Rachel's work as he is seen looking at [[Joshua Burgin|Joshua]] dressed up and smiling. Alternatively he may be gay and attracted to Joshua.\n\n==Appearances==\n* \"[[The One With Rachel's Crush]]\" (First appearance)\n* \"[[The One With Joey's Dirty Day]]\"\n* \"[[The One With All The Haste]]\" (mentioned only)\n* \"[[The One With Mac And C.H.E.E.S.E.]]\" (mentioned in flashback)\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 4 Characters]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Uncles]]\n[[Category:Rachel's Work]]\n[[Category:Non-Americans]]\n[[Category:LGBT Characters]]\n[[Category:English Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
