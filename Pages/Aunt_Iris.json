She was portrayed by [[Beverly Garland]].\n\nIt is unknown if Aunt Iris is the sister of [[Jack Geller]] or [[Judy Geller]], or if she is a sister-in-law, a cousin or a colleague to one of them, or a neighbor or a friend of the family.\n\nIn a deleted scene, Iris says that she recently talked to Monica's cousin Nathan who thinks he is a man trapped in a woman's body. From her line it is unclear if Nathan is her son, nephew, son-in-law or friend.\n\nFrom her limited interaction with Monica, [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] and [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]], Iris\u00a0appeared to be a witty and sarcastic, but not\u00a0very\u00a0nice or pleasant\u00a0individual.\u00a0Rachel and Phoebe\u00a0meet her when Monica asks her for assistance in learning to play poker, since Iris had been\u00a0playing poker since she was five according to Monica, and the three women needed to prepare for an upcoming game of poker with Ross, [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]], and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]]. Iris agreed to teach them how to play, but probably because she had parked her car\u00a0at a meter\u00a0wasn't very patient with or polite to them, not\u00a0bothering to say hello to them when she walked into the apartment\u00a0but instead\u00a0opening up the conversation by claiming to have hit Tony Randall with her car, then revealing that she was lying in order to demonstrate bluffing to them. She was later annoyed when they lost the game of poker to Joey, Chandler and Ross\u00a0despite\u00a0her\u00a0advice\u00a0and offered to teach them again, but she once again failed to be\u00a0friendly towards them.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Ross & Monica's Family]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Aunts]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
