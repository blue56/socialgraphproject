He was portrayed by [[Nicky Katt]].\n\n[[Ross Geller|Ross]] and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] encounter him and his friend [[Carl (bully)|Carl]] for the first time after accidentally stealing their seats while in the coffee shop.\u00a0Despite the muscular, powerful build of Arthur and Carl, Chandler (most likely because of their formal, smart, and well-dressed appearances in suits and ties) feels comfortable enough in their presence to\u00a0make a joke regarding the incident, but\u00a0Arthur and Carl seem to get the impression that he is mocking them, so Arthur steals his hat in retaliation.\u00a0Although initially frightened,\u00a0Ross and Chandler\u00a0later decide to confront them despite doubting their ability to win a fight with the two more physically imposing men. However, while they and the two\u00a0now more casually dressed bullies are discussing the rules for the fight, Ross and Chandler\u00a0notice some wannabe thieves making off with the valuables they had set aside for the fight and give chase. Ironically, the four men end up joining forces to chase down and fight off the would-be thieves, and they bury the hatchet.\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Antagonists]]"}}}]}}}}
