The date goes really awful for her, as she just found out that Ross is in love with her. While Carl keeps rambling on about Ed Begly Jr. and his electric car, she even shares a kiss with Ross in her fantasy. She then leaves the date to pick up Ross from the airport and leaves Carl to Monica, who agrees to finish the date when Rachel tells her that he is a banker with opera tickets. He's never seen again.\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Rachel's relationships]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
