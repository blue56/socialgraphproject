Alarmed, Monica tries to help him find a shirt that might distract from the brightness of his teeth, but nothing works. Ultimately, Ross puts on make-up to lighten his skin as well. In order to hide his teeth on his date, Ross barely says a word, finding ways to cover his mouth when he does speak. Hilary is impressed by what a good listener Ross seems to be. When Hillary finally sees Ross's teeth glowing brightly under a black light, she is freaked out.\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Ross' relationships]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Monica's Work]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
