She is mentioned in \"[[The One With The Sonogram At The End]]\" while Carol, [[Ross Geller|Ross]] and [[Susan Bunch|Susan]] are discussing names for the [[Ben Geller|baby]]. When the name is said, Ross asks \"As in Minnie Mouse?\", but Carol answers \"As in my grandmother.\" From that episode onward she would never be mentioned again. She was also never seen.\n\nIt is unclear if she is Carol's paternal or maternal grandmother. In the first case, her last name may be Willick, not in the second.\n\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Mothers]]\n[[Category:Grandmothers]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
