He has been in prison for unknown reasons and not been seen for the entire series. He is only mentioned occasionally by his stepdaughter [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]].\n\nWhile little is known about their relationship, Phoebe talks about him as though she and her stepfather were close. On the twins birthdays he would sell his blood to buy them food, and one time in her youth, he pulled her around on an empty box and helped her pretend it was a bike, since she didn't have one as a kid, and to make it fair, she 'pulled him around too'.\n\nPrior to her wedding to [[Mike]], her stepfather was going to get a weekend furlough from prison so that he could attend her wedding and walk her down the aisle, but was unable to attend because \"apparently stabbing Iceman in the exercise yard just couldn't wait till Monday\", forcing [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]], and later [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]], to fill in for him.\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's Family]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Fathers]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
