Ben is played as an infant by Michael Gunderson, by brothers\u00a0Charles Thomas Allen and John Christoper Allen\u00a0from Season 3 to 5, and by\u00a0Cole Sprouse\u00a0from Season 6 to 8.\n*Gender: Male\n*Date of birth: May 11, 1995\n=='''Emma Geller-Greene'''==\n'''Emma Geller-Greene'''\u00a0is the daughter of\u00a0[[Ross Geller]]\u00a0and\u00a0[[Rachel Greene]].

Monica and Chandler were unaware at the time of their birth that they would be receiving twins and Monica had to calm Chandler down at first.

Monica and Chandler were unaware at the time of their birth that they would be receiving twins and Monica had to calm Chandler down at first.
