Janice introduces a newborn Aaron to Rachel and Ross, making the joke that he is 'Emma's future husband'. The two both seem to be taken aback by his face, meaning that Aaron may be unfortunately ugly to look at, and out of earshot, Ross asks Rachel in shock, \"Did you see the kid on that nose?\" Janice implies that she will pay for plastic surgery to replace the nose to make him more attractive.\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Aaron would be {{AgeCalc|2002-05-04}}. Aaron and\u00a0[[Emma Geller-Green]], Ross and Rachel's daughter, were born the same day, meaning that Aaron's birthday is April 4, 2002, just like [[Emma Geller-Green|Emma]]. It is not impossible (and it\u2019s very likely) that they would end up going to school together and be in the same grade.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 8 Characters]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
