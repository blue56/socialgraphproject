She is a cartoonist living in a Manhattan loft. She spends many episodes searching for a date/husband and meddling in the lives of those around her. The series began shortly after she had broken up with her boyfriend Del, who quickly found a date. She hires Richard Karinsky to be her new colorist in the first episode, and he pretended to be her new boyfriend during a dinner to prevent her from being embarrassed over Del's moving on. Richard develops feelings for Caroline throughout the first season.\n\nCaroline makes a crossover appearance in ''[[Friends]]'' in \"[[The One With The Baby On The Bus]]\".\n\n==On ''Friends''==\nIn \"The One With The Baby On The Bus\", [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] and [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] take care of [[Ben Geller|Ben]] while [[Ross Geller|Ross]] goes to the hospital due to an allergic reaction.
