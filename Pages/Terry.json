One common interpretation of his disappearance is that he retired, leaving Gunther to run the coffee house in his place.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 2 Characters]]\n[[Category:Central Perk]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Rachel's Work]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Joey's Work]]"}}}]}}}}
