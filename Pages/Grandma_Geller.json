So if the landlord ever asks, I'm a 87-year-old woman who's afraid of her VCR.|Monica Geller|source=The One With The Flashbacks}}\n'''Ross and Monica's grandmother''' (also known as '''Nana''' and '''Grandma''') is the paternal grandmother of [[Ross Geller|Ross]] and [[Monica Geller]].\n\nShe was the original tenant of [[Monica's apartment]] and was still the legal resident even after moving to South Florida and Monica moving into the apartment (\"[[The One With The Flashback]]\", \"[[The One With The Ballroom Dancing]]\").\n\nRoss briefly lived with her for a summer during college, when he tried to make it as a dancer. Ross described her as a \"lurker\" in casinos which helped her pay for his dance lessons. Monica offers Ross to take over the apartment since the lease is still in their grandmother's name. When moving out the apartment, Chandler uncover her fuzzy handcuffs and later explicit pictures of her in the closet of Rachel's former bedroom. When Monica first meets [[Joey Tribbiani]], she says her grandmother is 87 years old and afraid of her VCR. She attends Monica's wedding to Chandler where her daughter-in-law [[Judy Geller|Judy]] describes her as, \"that old crone.\"\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The One With The Flashback]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One In Vegas, Part 2]]\" (Mentioned Only)\n*\"[[The One With Monica And Chandler's Wedding, Part 2]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The One With Rachel's Going Away Party]]\" (Mentioned only)\n*\"[[The Last One]]\" (Mentioned Only)\n[[Category:Friends Characters|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Females|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Ross & Monica's Family|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Grandmothers|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Widows|Geller Grandma]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
