He closes down almost every restaurant they eat in because it violates the rules, leading to problems with Phoebe when he wants to close [[Central Perk]], which he instead just gives a warning. He's never seen again afterwards.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Phoebe's relationships]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
