She was portrayed by [[Anna Faris]].\n\nThere was initially some confusion during the adoption process - Erica had confused Chandler and Monica's file with a couple who were a doctor and a reverend. However, Chandler eventually convinced Monica to admit the truth, subsequently winning Erica over despite the lie by convincing her that they had only lied because Monica so desperately wanted a child.\n\nDuring a later visit to New York, Erica admitted that she was uncertain whether the father of her baby was her high school boyfriend -- a football champion -- or a guy who was in prison for killing his father with a shovel. However, Monica confirmed that it was the football player because what Erica did with the shovel-killer doesn't lead to pregnancy. Precisely what this was is unknown, but allegedly Chandler and Monica never do it themselves, prompting Chandler to be somewhat impressed with \"[[Shovelly Joe]]\". \n\nIn \"[[The Last One]]\" Erica gives birth, revealing that she was actually pregnant with twins -- something that ran in her family -- but she had misinterpreted the reference to two heartbeats as referring to her heart and the baby's. Chandler and Monica subsequently name the boy [[Jack Bing|Jack]] (after [[Jack Geller|Monica's father]]) and the girl [[Erica Bing|Erica]] (after her birth mother).\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery type=\"slideshow\" position=\"center\">\nAnna-faris.jpg|Erica giving birth.\nAnna Fairs Friends.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n== Trivia ==\n* Erica was the last recurring character to appear.\n* She was the second to give birth to more than 1 child, the first being [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]].\n* Chandler and Monica's daughter was named after her.\n* She gave up her twins in an open adoption, meaning Monica and Chandler would remain in contact with her.\n\n== Appearances ==\n* \"[[The One With The Late Thanksgiving]]\" (First Mentioned)\n* \"[[The One With The Birth Mother]]\" (First Appearance)\n* \"[[The One Where Chandler Gets Caught]]\" (Mentioned Only)\n* \"[[The One Where Joey Speaks French]]\"\n* \"[[The One Where Estelle Dies]]\" (Mentioned Only)\n* [[The One With Rachel's Going Away Party]]\n* [[The Last One, Part 1]] (Final Appearance)\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Mothers]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
