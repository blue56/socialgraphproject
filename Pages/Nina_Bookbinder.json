She is a cute employee at [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]]'s office. It is assumed that Chandler is her boss (or at least above her position at the company).\n\nChandler's boss, [[Mr. Douglas]], tells him that he needs to fire Nina. However Chandler can't bring himself to do so and instead, in a moment of haste, asks her out to dinner and they begin dating. Chandler convinces Mr. Douglas that Nina is crazy and that she would have no recollection of being fired at all. Eventually he gets caught and tells Nina everything. He later tells the group that she took it \"pretty well... except for the stapler thing,\" and raises his bandaged hand.\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 1 Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Chandler's relationships]]\n[[Category:Chandler's Work]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
