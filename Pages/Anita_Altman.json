It was mentioned that she had made out with [[Ross Geller|Ross]] and with [[Ta-Taka-Ki-Kek]].\n\nRoss was working late in the library one afternoon and there was only the two of them and she needed some help with a word jumble, and Ross said she was very gentle and tender. [[Rachel Greene|Rachel]] witnessed the two of them due to her being in the library because they had magazines.\n\nRoss then said 'May she rest in peace', likely indicating that she has died. Monica asked \"Didn't she walk with a cane?\" and Ross replied \"Only when it was damp!\"\n\nAccording to Ross, she didn't look 50, though Chandler asked if she \"look[ed] 16\" to him.\n\n==Appearances==\n*\"[[The One With The Rumor]]\" (Mentioned only)\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Unseen Characters]]\n[[Category:Deceased Characters]]\n[[Category:Ross' relationships]]\n[[Category:Lincoln High School]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
