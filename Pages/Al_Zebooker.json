Joey speculated that he probably \"eats more money than he makes\". He is first heard leaving a message on Joey's phone informing him that Estelle had died. In this message, he referred to himself, in a weary tone of voice, as \"the guy who eats paper,\" implying that Joey can't remember his real name and consequently only ever refers to him as that, to Al's irritation judging from his weary tone of voice. At Estelle's funeral he ate Joey's notes.\n\n==Trivia==\n*The actor, [[E.J. Callahan]], also plays [[Mr. Simon]] in \"[[The One With The Ballroom Dancing]]\".\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 10 Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Males]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
