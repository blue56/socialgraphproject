She was portrayed by [[Joanna Gleason]].\n\nUpset that she doesn't get a say in any decisions made on the smoking break, Rachel pretends that she smokes to air her opinions to her boss. She encourages her boss and other colleague to quit smoking, but catches them smoking anyway. Rachel's boss believes that Rachel has really tried her hardest to give up, so threatens that she will lose her job if she catches her smoking again. \n\nKim is briefly mentioned in \"[[The One Where Ross Hugs Rachel]]\" when she calls Rachel \"Raquel\" in the middle of a staff meeting, resulting in the rest of the staff, unwilling to correct her, calling Rachel \"Raquel\" as well. \n\nIn \"[[The One With Ross' Teeth]]\", she appears to begin liking Rachel after she gossips about [[Phoebe Buffay]]'s alleged kiss with [[Ralph Lauren]] (while in fact Phoebe made out with [[Kenny]] the copy boy believing he was Ralph Lauren). Kim mistakenly believes it was in fact Rachel who kissed Ralph, trying to get Kim's job. She changes her mind when she sees Ralph give Rachel \"the coldest look [she's] ever seen\".\u00a0She then tries to comfort Rachel, saying \"We've all been there\" and admits she had an affair with [[Kenny]].\n\nAlthough not truly intending to be, Kim is one of the recurring characters in Friends to appear as a minor antagonist. The reason why is because of her rude and mean nature towards Rachel. She is not as antagonistic as some other despicable characters though.\n[[Category:Recurring Characters]]\n[[Category:Rachel's Work]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 5 Characters]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]\n[[Category:Bullying Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
