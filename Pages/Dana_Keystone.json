In the episode, she is directing a movie in which [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]] wants to play, so Chandler agrees to call her and ask her for a favor. When this turns out to be a little harder than expected and he has to see her again, this causes problems between him and [[Monica Geller|Monica]] when he mentions that he once dated her.\n\nOn their second meeting, Dana mistakenly thinks Chandler has fallen for her again and tells him she does not feel the same way. Saddened, she then says she'll do whatever he wants to make him feel better, after which Chandler asks to give Joey an audition.\n\nNonetheless, after all the trouble Chandler went to get Joey his audition, he did not get the part as he forgot all about it.\n[[Category:Chandler's relationships]]\n[[Category:Characters]]\n[[Category:Females]]\n[[Category:Friends Characters]]\n[[Category:One Appearance Only]]\n[[Category:Season 6 Characters]]"}}}]}}}}
