paranoid  or in this case I mean you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight  You kidding You re the most beautiful woman in most rooms   But we don t do that  How drunk are you    What  I know  Well I have kissed over four women  Okay  It bodes well for me that speed impresses you  Yep  Count of three  Two  Well I think it s safe to say that our friendship is effectively ruined  Eh  So are you really gonna go out with that nurse man  Y know I don t know if you ve ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary  Well I have and the technical definition is two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together But if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me then we have to y know get you my original

Yeah look when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then then that s what we re gonna do  Eh forget about the future and stuff So we only have two kids y know We ll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college  Yeah  Uh four a boy twin girls and another boy  Well stuff like where we d live y know Like a small place outside the city where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff Y know we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door Of course we d have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old  Sure you do  You sure  I love you so much  Hey  I wanted to be with you I missed you so much  Monica  I never want to leave you again  Turns out they can t fire me Because I quit  Yeah It s a stupid job and I could not stand leaving you And why should I be the only one who doesn t get to do what he    I know

Hey  I ve got nowhere to go this morning I m unemployed I don t know what I m gonna do with my life  I mean what am I supposed to do with myself  But it s all so overwhelming I don t know where to

starting a family  Yeah  Yeah Ross is here so   Hey  Oh yeah But you have to give it back if I get a job Of course by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we ll all be wearing silver jump suits  Oh god I have to tell you something You re not pregnant  That thing that I have to do to make a baby I faked it  Oh yes you can You just make the faces and the noises  That s actually why Look

my stuff  Yeah me too Look I ll just get my old job back  I quit and you learn what I do  I guess It s always gonna be scary when we have a baby  Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind  Oh and I promise I will not fake it this time  Hey Oh she s at home putting up decorations for Rachel s birthday party tonight  I tried but apparantly singing  Yes Bravo on the hot nanny

policeman You re not actually going to send these out are ya  No come on you know that s not true  Well the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community  Alright look let s think about this ok do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time That people are gonna post condolences on a website This is not about people not caring that you re dead This is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief  Right I mean come on I m sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service tons of people would come  Ross what re you  what re you  what are you doing  Ross don t press send don t press se    There you go Someone came    Oh yes yes  let me  take your coat  At least he died doing what he loved  watching blimps  Some guy Tom Gordon    Ok

I think I can safely say that we all have family issues work stuff and But you come first    Not as much fun as last time Apparently you only get porn if you re giving a sperm sample  Well  there s surrogacy but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be  too hard for her  Yeah  Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so  we re talking about sperm donors    I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I don t think there is one  Hey Look I brought a friend for dinner this is Zack from work  You guys haven t actually met before but boy You re both polite    So how would you like to have a baby that s half yours and half his  Well we re talking about sperm donors and Zack may be the guy I mean look he s

enjoying that Ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth Did you have braces as a child    You sure you don t wanna stick around a little longer  Are you just tired now or are you always tired  cause that could be a sign of clinical depression  Ok  I think we ve found our sperm  Yeah you think so well Should I ask him  Why not just because his great Yeah he s better  Really Are you sure    So you know this leaves us with   How do you feel about that  Me too I wanna find a baby that needs a home and I wanna raise it with you And I wanna mess it up in our own specific way    We are gonna be Wait if

Oh ain t this nice It s so quiet I could just lie here all day  I m so glad we ve got adjoining rooms  Hey Remember when I had corneas  Ladies Ross s speech is in 45 minutes      I don t think so  Because you know how competitive you get and well I say it s cute others disagree and I m lying  Oh  And   I m not playing with you  She gets crazy This scar        Honey try to focus the trash talk

break of dawn  What are you singing  It s  Did I Let s refresh I believe what I said was  that I could see your scalp  Again let s journey back  As I recall what Rachel  said was she had never notice the shape of your skull before And Joey   Well Joey didn t realise that there was anything different  Hit yourself in the tooth  Honey you ve been in there for a long time   Is everything okay  Really What happened  You can t move at all  If I untangle you will you please get rid of the corn rose    Now that I untangled you how bout you doing a  little something for me  I think you know  This is

talking to your  parents They re telling us all about how they adopted you  What  I got nothing  Where are Bill and Colleen  We have to leave  I didn t get to the bathroom I bumped into Owen on the way  and he didn t know he was adopted And there s a slight chance I may  have told him  But kids are so intuitive Don t you think on some level he  already knows  See Intuitive  Which technically now you should give back  I m so sorry but you should have a sign out there or  something Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the  door  Owen didn t know he was adopted and Monica told him  Yeah but how would you like it if someone told the triplets  that you gave birth to them  I m gonna go tell Emma she was an accident  Yeah We don t feel like we can host Thanksgiving this year  Well

Dinner is at four we ll never gonna make it back  You say that now but it could take us a long time to get back home Plus Joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up  Look
