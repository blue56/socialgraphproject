 Oh ok Fine I ll just I ll take the hat back  My songs aren t good enough for your restaurant  Then what s wrong with them Would they not go with your tiny portions of pretentious food  Yeah well  Well  it s not about quality  Well at least all my songs don t taste like garlic Yeah there are other ingredients Monica  Ear plugs or cloves of garlic  What are people having the garlic Martini    You d better get back in that kitchen Monica the garlic is not gonna overuse itself  Why The only person my playing is bothering is you    Ok ok how many of you  Ok well who identified the tone of this restaurant as pretentious comma garlicky  Ok well alright who thinks the food is fine the music was fine but your evening was ruined by this incessant poll taking  Oh  Who was so stupid and stubborn that she lashed out against her friend s cooking which she actually thinks is pretty great  I m sorry too   Yeah As long as it s free Food here is ridiculously over   What is it  I know I

But that woman can t know I work  here She s a friend of mine and I made this big stink about how awful this  massage chains are   Cause it s good money But that doesn t change the fact that  this is an evil blood sucking corporate machine      Okay then I m Swedish   It s a normal Swedish name  Ikea   Ja    Is something wrong      Oh Ja Ja  Uhu uhu  and why do you think that is  Or  maybe she has
