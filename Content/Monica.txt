time to clean it What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer  Messes up all the ribbons  What if there s no room for a ribbon drawer because the baby s stuff takes up all the space  Where will all the ribbons go   Yes please  I wish I could say the same I m a little shook up  Would you stop staring at her  What s the big deal with her Maybe she s attractive in an obvious kind  of way  Yeah Hey
