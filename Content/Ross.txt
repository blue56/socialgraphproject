situation so you float the idea of a threesome    Yep we got it we got it  Good night    Then we have to await the data from recent MRI scans and DNA testing which call into question information gathered from years of simple carbon dating  Finally factoring the profusion of new species recently discovered And that s just the herbivores I m not even gonna discuss the carnivores their heads are already too big Which is ironic considering their stunted cerebral development  But all kidding aside in much the same way that Homo ergaster    and while there are certainly vast differences between
